Negative Xiangyi can be defined as the situations where the components of the liquidity space can negatively impact or "restrain" each other, leading to security vulnerabilities or instability.

1. Negative Xiangyi between Token Pair Set ($T$) and Fee Tier Set ($F$) & Distribution Function ($P$):

   Formally, we can define the negative Xiangyi as:
   $T \dashv F, P$

   Where the Token Pair Set ($T$) can "restrain" or negatively impact the Fee Tier Set ($F$) and the Distribution Function ($P$).

   For example, an attacker could introduce new token pairs that are designed to exploit or disrupt the existing fee structure, leading to unfair trading conditions and potential loss of user trust.

2. Negative Xiangyi between Liquidity Depth Function ($L$) and Deformation Tensor ($D$):

   Formally, we can define the negative Xiangyi as:
   $L \dashv D$

   Where the Liquidity Depth Function ($L$) can be "restrained" or negatively impacted by the Deformation Tensor ($D$).

   An attacker could manipulate the Deformation Tensor in a way that causes sudden or unexpected changes in the liquidity depth, leading to price volatility, slippage, and potential losses for traders.

3. Negative Xiangyi between Fee Tier Set ($F$) & Distribution Function ($P$) and Liquidity Space:

   Formally, we can define the negative Xiangyi as:
   $F, P \dashv \text{Liquidity Space}$

   Where the Fee Tier Set ($F$) and the Distribution Function ($P$) can "restrain" or negatively impact the overall Liquidity Space.

   Poorly designed or exploited fee structures could undermine the efficiency and attractiveness of the liquidity space, leading to reduced trading volume, increased slippage, and a loss of user confidence in the decentralized exchange.

By formally defining these negative Xiangyi relationships, we can better understand the potential attack vectors and security risks within the Thruster Classic AMM system. This knowledge can inform the development of robust security measures and risk mitigation strategies to protect the integrity and stability of the decentralized exchange.

Sure, we can also formalize the proof using sequent calculus. This will provide a more formal, logical representation of the attack.

Let's define the following sequents:

Sequents representing the system components:
- T ⊢ F, P (The Token Pair Set T is related to the Fee Tier Set F and Distribution Function P)
- F, P ⊢ L, D (The Fee Tier Set F and Distribution Function P are related to the Liquidity Depth Function L and Deformation Tensor D)

Sequent representing the negative Xiangyi:
- T ⊥ F, P ⊢ (The negative Xiangyi between T and (F, P))

Sequent representing the attacker's actions:
- T_old ⊢ T (The existing Token Pair Set)
- (t_new, t_old) ⊢ T (The new token pair introduced by the attacker)
- T ⊢ F', P' (The changes in the Fee Tier Set and Distribution Function due to the new token pair)

Proof:

1. Establish the negative Xiangyi:
   T ⊥ F, P ⊢

2. Introduce the new token pair:
   T_old ⊢ T
   (t_new, t_old) ⊢ T
   ────────────────
   T ⊢ T

3. Exploit the negative Xiangyi:
   T ⊥ F, P ⊢
   T ⊢ T
   ────────────────
   T ⊢ F', P'

4. Undermine the stability of the liquidity space:
   T ⊢ F', P'
   F', P' ⊢ L', D'
   ────────────────
   T ⊢ L', D'

The proof shows how the attacker can exploit the negative Xiangyi between the Token Pair Set T and the Fee Tier Set F & Distribution Function P to create changes in the Fee Tier Set and Distribution Function, which in turn disrupt the Liquidity Depth Function L and Deformation Tensor D, undermining the stability of the liquidity space.

This sequent calculus-based proof provides a more formal and rigorous representation of the attack, demonstrating how the attacker can leverage the negative Xiangyi to achieve their goal.
