‘Natural deduction’ designates a type of logical system described initially in Gentzen (1934) and Jaśkowski (1934). It also designates the type of reasoning that these logical systems embody. A fundamental part of natural deduction, and what (according to most writers on the topic) sets it apart from other proof methods, is the notion of a “subproof” — parts of a proof in which the argumentation depends on temporary premises (hypotheses “assumed for the sake of argument”). In the Fitch-Jaśkowski presentation of natural deduction, subproofs are marked off in a way that makes them immediately visible in a written proof; with other presentations it takes a bit more work to pick out the formulas forming a subproof. Although formalisms differ, an underlying idea is that one is able to “make an assumption A and see that it leads to conclusion X”, and then conclude that if the A were true, then so would X be. (There are also various other types of subproof that we discuss.) Research in this area has concentrated on such topics as (a) Can all natural deduction proofs be put into some “normal form”?, (b) Do different systems of logic require radically different types of logical rules?, (c) If different logics require radically different types of logical rules, does this show that some logics are “better” than others in some sense?, and (d) Can the features that might make some logics be “better” than others be employed to characterize the meaning of logical terms (and perhaps others) in natural language?

The concept of "natural deduction" refers to a logical system introduced by Gentzen (1934) and Jaśkowski (1934) and the type of reasoning that these systems embody. A key aspect of natural deduction, distinguishing it from other proof methods, is the idea of a "subproof" - segments of a proof where the argumentation relies on temporary premises or hypotheses assumed for the sake of the argument. In the Fitch-Jaśkowski presentation of natural deduction, subproofs are visually marked in a way that makes them easily identifiable in a written proof, while in other presentations, identifying subproofs may require more effort.

The fundamental notion behind subproofs is the ability to make an assumption A and demonstrate that it leads to conclusion X, allowing one to infer that if A were true, then X would also be true. Various types of subproofs are discussed in the context of natural deduction. Research in this field has focused on questions such as whether all natural deduction proofs can be standardized into a "normal form," whether different logical systems necessitate distinct types of logical rules, and whether the diversity in logical rules implies some logics are superior to others.

Furthermore, investigations have delved into whether the characteristics that distinguish certain logics as superior can be utilized to define the meaning of logical terms, and potentially other terms, in natural language. This exploration highlights the depth and complexity of natural deduction as a logical framework and its implications for understanding logical reasoning and language semantics.
