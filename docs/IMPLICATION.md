Great, let's incorporate the concepts of implication and bi-implication from Notation 1.1.1 into our discussion of the liquidity space.

1. Implications in the Liquidity Space:
   - We can use the implication symbol ⇒ to express relationships between properties of the liquidity space.
   - For example, we can say:
     - "If the liquidity depth for the ETH-USDC pair increases, then the Deformation Tensor for that pair will change."
     - Formally: $L(ETH, USDC, t_2) > L(ETH, USDC, t_1) \Rightarrow D(L(ETH, USDC, t_2), P(f, t_2)) \neq D(L(ETH, USDC, t_1), P(f, t_1))$

2. Bi-implications in the Liquidity Space:
   - We can use the bi-implication symbol ⇔ to express equivalence relationships in the liquidity space.
   - For example, we can say:
     - "The liquidity depth for the ETH-USDC pair is constant if and only if the Deformation Tensor for that pair is zero."
     - Formally: $L(ETH, USDC, t) = L(ETH, USDC, t_0) \forall t \geq t_0 \Leftrightarrow D(L(ETH, USDC, t), P(f, t)) = 0 \forall t \geq t_0$

3. Reasoning with Implications and Bi-implications:
   - We can use the implication and bi-implication symbols to reason about the properties of the liquidity space.
   - For example, we can derive new statements from the given implications and bi-implications.
   - If we know that "the liquidity depth for the ETH-USDC pair increases" and that "an increase in liquidity depth implies a change in the Deformation Tensor", then we can conclude that "the Deformation Tensor for the ETH-USDC pair will change."

By incorporating the concepts of implication and bi-implication, we can express more complex relationships and properties within the liquidity space. This allows us to reason about the behavior of the liquidity space in a more precise and formal manner, which is essential for understanding and analyzing the Thruster Classic AMM.

The use of these logical symbols helps us build a rigorous mathematical foundation for the liquidity space, enabling us to make deductions, derive new insights, and validate the expected properties of the Thruster Classic AMM.

Okay, let's try an example that combines the concepts from Definitions 1.1.1 (implication and bi-implication) and 1.1.3 (equality and subset relations) in the context of the liquidity space.

Example:
Let's consider two liquidity pools, Pool A and Pool B, with the following properties:

1. Implication and Bi-implication:
   - Let P(f, t) be the price function for the token pair in Pool A, and Q(f, t) be the price function for the token pair in Pool B.
   - We know that:
     - If the liquidity depth L(A) in Pool A increases, then the Deformation Tensor D(L(A), P(f, t)) for Pool A changes.
     - Formally: $L(A, t_2) > L(A, t_1) \Rightarrow D(L(A, t_2), P(f, t_2)) \neq D(L(A, t_1), P(f, t_1))$
     - The liquidity depth L(B) in Pool B is constant if and only if the Deformation Tensor D(L(B), Q(f, t)) for Pool B is zero.
     - Formally: $L(B, t) = L(B, t_0) \forall t \geq t_0 \Leftrightarrow D(L(B, t), Q(f, t)) = 0 \forall t \geq t_0$

2. Equality and Subset Relations:
   - Let T_A and T_B be the sets of token pairs in Pool A and Pool B, respectively.
   - Let F_A and F_B be the sets of fee tiers in Pool A and Pool B, respectively.
   - We want to compare the properties of the two pools using the concepts of equality and subset relations.
   - We can say that:
     - The sets of token pairs in the two pools are equal: $T_A = T_B$
     - The set of fee tiers in Pool A is a subset of the set of fee tiers in Pool B: $F_A \subseteq F_B$

By combining the implications and bi-implications from Definition 1.1.1 with the set-theoretic concepts from Definition 1.1.3, we can make the following deductions:

1. Since the liquidity depth L(A) in Pool A increases, the Deformation Tensor D(L(A), P(f, t)) for Pool A changes.
2. Since the set of fee tiers in Pool A is a subset of the set of fee tiers in Pool B, we can infer that the Deformation Tensor D(L(B), Q(f, t)) for Pool B is also non-zero (i.e., the liquidity depth L(B) in Pool B is not constant).

This example demonstrates how the logical implications and set-theoretic relationships can be used together to reason about the properties of the liquidity space and draw conclusions about the behavior of the Thruster Classic AMM.
