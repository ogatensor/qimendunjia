Okay, let's define the liquidity space using the set theory concepts from Definition 1.1.1.

1. Liquidity Pool Composition:
   - The liquidity pool is a set of token pairs, where each pair has a specific liquidity depth.
   - Let's define the set of token pairs as:
     $$T = \{(token_i, token_j) | i, j \in \mathbb{N}, i \neq j\}$$
   - For each token pair $(token_i, token_j) \in T$, the liquidity depth is defined as a function:
     $$L: T \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$$
     such that $L(token_i, token_j)$ represents the liquidity depth for the pair $(token_i, token_j)$.

2. Liquidity Distribution:
   - The liquidity is distributed across a set of fee tiers, with each fee tier having a specific percentage of the overall liquidity.
   - Let's define the set of fee tiers as:
     $$F = \{f_1, f_2, ..., f_K\}$$
   - The percentage of liquidity in each fee tier is defined as a function:
     $$P: F \rightarrow [0, 1]$$
     such that $\sum_{f \in F} P(f) = 1$.

3. Liquidity Dynamics:
   - The liquidity space is dynamic, with changes in the liquidity depth and distribution over time.
   - The time-dependent variables are defined as:
     - $$L: T \times \mathbb{R}^+ \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$$
       such that $L(token_i, token_j, t)$ represents the liquidity depth for the pair $(token_i, token_j)$ at time $t$.
     - $$P: F \times \mathbb{R}^+ \rightarrow [0, 1]$$
       such that $P(f, t)$ represents the percentage of liquidity in the fee tier $f$ at time $t$.

4. Deformation Tensor:
   - The Deformation Tensor, denoted as $D$, captures the changes in the liquidity space over time.
   - The Deformation Tensor is defined as a function of the liquidity depth and distribution:
     $$D: (T \times \mathbb{R}^+) \times (F \times \mathbb{R}^+) \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$$
     such that $D(L(token_i, token_j, t), P(f, t))$ represents the Deformation Tensor at time $t$.

5. Assertions:
   - The expected deformations in the liquidity space can be expressed as assertions.

In this definition, we have:
- Defined the set of token pairs $T$ and the set of fee tiers $F$, following the concepts from Definition 1.1.1.
- Specified the functions $L$ and $P$ to represent the liquidity depth and fee tier percentages, respectively.
- Introduced the time-dependent variables to capture the dynamic nature of the liquidity space.
- Defined the Deformation Tensor $D$ as a function of the liquidity depth and distribution.
- Mentioned the use of assertions to express the expected deformations in the liquidity space.

This set-theoretic formulation provides a rigorous mathematical foundation for the Thruster Classic AMM and allows us to reason about the properties of the liquidity space, such as the associativity property we discussed earlier.
