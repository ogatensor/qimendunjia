# Representation and Formalism  
We'll represent the Six Harmonies using a 6x6 matrix, where each row and column correspond to one of the six harmonies:

1. Xin (emotional mind)
2. Yi (wisdom mind)
3. Qi
4. Li (muscular power)
5. Upper body (hands, elbows, shoulders)
6. Lower body (feet, knees, hips)

The matrix will be populated with values representing the strength of the relationship between each pair of harmonies. A value of 1 represents a strong, harmonious relationship, while a value of -1 represents a disharmonious or imbalanced relationship. A value of 0 represents no direct relationship.

Six Harmonies Matrix:

1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
