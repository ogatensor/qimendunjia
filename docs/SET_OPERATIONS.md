Okay, let's do an example that showcases how the set operations defined in Definition 1.1.2 can be useful in the context of the liquidity space.

Example:
Suppose we have three liquidity pools: Pool A, Pool B, and Pool C. Each pool has its own set of token pairs and fee tiers. Let's denote the sets as follows:

- Token pairs:
  - Pool A: $T_A$
  - Pool B: $T_B$
  - Pool C: $T_C$
- Fee tiers:
  - Pool A: $F_A$
  - Pool B: $F_B$
  - Pool C: $F_C$

Now, let's consider the following scenarios and see how the set operations can be useful:

1. **Identifying the unique token pairs across all pools:**
   - To find the set of all unique token pairs supported by the Thruster Classic AMM, we can use the union operation:
     - $T = T_A \cup T_B \cup T_C$
   - This gives us the complete set of token pairs that can be traded across the three pools.

2. **Determining the common fee tiers across all pools:**
   - To find the set of fee tiers that are shared by all three pools, we can use the intersection operation:
     - $F = F_A \cap F_B \cap F_C$
   - This allows us to identify the fee tiers that are supported by the Thruster Classic AMM across all its liquidity pools.

3. **Analyzing the differences in fee tiers between pools:**
   - To find the fee tiers that are unique to Pool B compared to Pool A, we can use the complement operation:
     - $F_B \setminus F_A$
   - This gives us the set of fee tiers that are available in Pool B but not in Pool A, which can be useful for understanding the differences in fee structures between the two pools.

4. **Identifying the token pairs and fee tiers exclusive to a specific pool:**
   - To find the token pairs and fee tiers that are unique to Pool C, we can use the complement operation:
     - $T_C \setminus (T_A \cup T_B)$
     - $F_C \setminus (F_A \cup F_B)$
   - These sets represent the token pairs and fee tiers that are exclusively available in Pool C, which can be valuable information for users and developers.

By using the set operations defined in Definition 1.1.2, we can gain valuable insights into the capabilities and features of the Thruster Classic AMM, such as the breadth of supported token pairs, the common fee tiers, and the differences between individual liquidity pools. These insights can help users make informed decisions about which pools to use and how to optimize their trading strategies.
