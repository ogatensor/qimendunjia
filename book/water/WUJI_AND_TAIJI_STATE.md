In Taoist philosophy, wuji symbolizes a boundless void, while taiji signifies the origin and conclusion of the world, serving as a pivotal moment. Wuji embodies an undifferentiated state, whereas taiji embodies a state of harmony and equilibrium between Yin and Yang. Taiji encompasses Yin and Yang, symbolizing the unity of contrasting forces that bring life to all entities.

The text discusses the concepts of wuji and taiji in Taoist philosophy. Wuji represents a limitless void, while taiji is the beginning and end of the world, a turning point. Wuji is the mechanism of both movement and quiescence, situated before the differentiation between the two. Taiji contains Yin and Yang, representing the unity of opposites that give life to all beings. In summary, wuji is the undifferentiated state, while taiji is the state of unity and balance between Yin and Yang.

Zhou's key terms wuji and taiji appear in the famous opening phrase wuji er taiji (無極而太極), which Adler notes could also be translated "The Supreme Polarity that is Non-Polar!".

Non-polar (wuji) and yet Supreme Polarity (taiji)! The Supreme Polarity in activity generates yang; yet at the limit of activity it is still. In stillness it generates yin; yet at the limit of stillness it is also active. Activity and stillness alternate; each is the basis of the other. In distinguishing yin and yang, the Two Modes are thereby established. The alternation and combination of yang and yin generate water, fire, wood, metal, and earth. With these five [phases of] qi harmoniously arranged, the Four Seasons proceed through them. The Five Phases are simply yin and yang; yin and yang are simply the Supreme Polarity; the Supreme Polarity is fundamentally Non-polar. [Yet] in the generation of the Five Phases, each one has its nature. 

Robinet explains the relationship.

The taiji is the One that contains Yin and Yang, or the Three (as stated in Hanshu 21A). This Three is, in Taoist terms, the One (Yang) plus the Two (Yin), or the Three that gives life to all beings (Daode jing 42), the One that virtually contains the multiplicity. Thus, the wuji is a limitless void, whereas the taiji is a limit in the sense that it is the beginning and the end of the world, a turning point. The wuji is the mechanism of both movement and quiescence; it is situated before the differentiation between movement and quiescence, metaphorically located in the space-time between the kun 坤, or pure Yin, and fu 復, the return of the Yang. In other terms, while the Taoists state that taiji is metaphysically preceded by wuji, which is the Dao, the Neo-Confucians say that the taiji is the Dao.

Chu Hsi's Comments

Chu Hsi says: "In [Chou Tun-i's] explanation of the Diagram, first he describes the origin of yin and yang, change and transformation; then he clarifies the matter, namely in terms of [the corresponding] endowment and constitution of human beings. When he says, `Man alone receives [the Five Agents] in their highest excellence and so is endowed with the fullest spir­itual potential,' [a reference to] man's pure and perfectly good nature, what he is speaking of is the Supreme Ultimate. `His physical form is produced and his spirit manifests [intelligence]' is the doing of the activity of yang and the quiet of yin. `His five-fold nature is stirred and acts' is the nature of Water, Fire, Wood, Metal, and Earth produced when yang changes and yin corresponds. `The distinction of good and evil arises' is the like­ness of the male and the female elements. `Human affairs take place' is the likeness of the production and transformation of the myriad creatures. And finally when we come to, `The Sage properly orders these [affairs] according to the mean, correctness, humanity, and righteousness, taking quiet as the essential; in this way he establishes the ultimate standard for man.' This again refers to man's having received the integral substance of the Supreme Ultimate, with the result that he is conjoined with Heaven and Earth in a perfect unity. Therefore the text goes on to say that with regard to Heaven and Earth, the sun and

moon, the four seasons, and the spirits, there is none with which he is not at one."10

T'oegye's Comments

This diagram and its accompanying explanation are both the work of Chou Lien-hsi [Tun-i]. Yeh Ping-yen12 spoke of this diagram as follows: "It takes the words of the Appended Remarks [of the Book of Changes], 'The Book of Changes has the Supreme Ultimate; this produced the Two Modes; the Two Modes produced the Four Forms,"13 and expands and clarifies its meaning. The only difference is that the Book of Changes speaks in terms of the hexagrams and their lines, while the Diagram speaks in terms of the creation and transformation [of the phys­ical universe]."14 Master Chu called it, "the great fountainhead of moral principle,"15 and again referred to it as "the source of proper understanding of the Tao through all ages."16

This diagram has been placed at the very beginning of

42          Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate

this work for the same reason that its explanation was placed at the beginning of [Chu Hsi's] Reflections on Things at Hand. That is, one who would learn to be a sage should seek the beginning here in this [diagram] and apply his efforts to the practice of [what is presented in] such works as the Elementary Learning and the Great Learning.17

When the day of reaping the fruits arrives and one com­pletely returns to the Single Origin, he will have arrived at the condition described as having "exhaustively comprehended prin­ciple, fully realized his nature, and so completely fulfilled the Mandate";18 he will have become "the person of perfectly ac­complished virtue who exhaustively comprehends the realm of the spirit and understands the transformations [of the universe]."19

COMMENTARY

On Beginning with the Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate

When T'oegye was nineteen years old he first obtained a copy of the first chüan of the Hsing-li to ch'iian, which presents this material along with Chu Hsi's commentary on it and extensive annotations from other sources; this, he says, first opened his eyes and provided him a real entree to the Neo-Confucian path.20 Although he was criticized by some for engaging his students in such lofty matters rather than concentrating on the basics of moral cultivation such as are found in the Elementary Learning (see below, ch. 3), he considered this material as basic and frequently lectured his students on it.21 We shall see that fundamental moral cultivation rather than philosophical theory is the essence of his approach to learning; but his own mind needed the support of grasping the overall framework, and he assumed the same for others:

[T'oegye] said: "Studying things on the lower level to arrive at the higher is certainly the constant order [of learning]. Nevertheless if those who pursue Teaming practice for a long time without attaining much, they easily reach the point of giving up in the middle. It is better to show them the basic foundation [of this whole endeavor]." Thus in guiding his students he showed them the fundamental well-springs. (ŎHN 1.21a,B, p. 799)

On the Relationship of Principe and Material Force

Li and ki (Chinese: li and ch'i,) principle and material force, are the two essential constituents of existence. They are ex

             Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate

plained in the Appendix on Terminology. The following passage sum­marizes the basic aspects of their relationship that are critical in the interpretation of this diagram:

Someone asked Master Chu, "What is the meaning of saying there must be principle and only then can there be material force?" [Master Chu] replied: "Fundamentally this cannot be spoken of in terms of prior and posterior; nonetheless if one must pursue the question of whence comes material force, then it is necessary to say that first there is this principle. But principle is not a separate thing: it exists in the midst of material force, and without this material force principle would have nothing to which to adhere."22 Now if one considers the matter in terms of these three statements, then principle and material force fundamentally are not mixed together and likewise are not separate from each other. If one does not speak of them separately, they flow together as a single thing and one fails to understand that they are not mixed; if one does not speak of them together, they become divided as two things and one fails to realize that they are not separate. (ŎHN 4.5a, B, p. 838)

The emphasis upon the separateness but inseparability of principle and material force reflects a critical balance necessary to a vision which might be described as a dualistic monism. In the monistic direction, there is a tendency to a monism of material force in which principle is reduced to the order inherent in material force, an interpretation instanced by the philosophies of Chang Tsai and Lo Chin-shun (1465-­1547)23 in China and Sŏ Kyŏngdok24 in Korea. T'oegye was acutely aware of this tendency and criticized it strongly;25 the dualism which he defends separates principle and gives it priority, as reflected in this passage. As the inborn norm of everything in the universe principle has a clear value priority; as the inborn nature of things it has a logical priority over any concrete instance of that nature. A third kind of priority, priority in the existential order of causality, is a vexatious issue in Chu Hsi's writings that has led historically to quite varied interpretations and developments of his thought. 26

Principle as the Indeterminate and the Supreme Ultimate

Chou's diagram was derived from Taoist sources. The phrase, wu-chi, in the first line of his Explanation would be translated as "the Ultimate of Non-Being" in a Taoist context, a reflection of that tradition's derivation of being from non-being. Chu Hsi, in adapt­ing this work to his own purposes, could not accept such an inter­pretation and strongly argued against it in his famous debate with Lu Hsiang-shan.27 He disarms the Taoist implications of wu-chi by inter­preting the phrase as a qualification of the Supreme Ultimate clarifying its unlimited and non-concrete nature. Thus I have rendered wu-chi as "the Indeterminate." T'oegye presents the rationale of this inter­pretation as follows:

Master Chu in discussing the Indeterminate and the Supreme Ultimate says: "If one does not say `the Indeterminate,' then the Supreme Ultimate would become the same as a single thing and would not suffice as the root of the ten thousand transformations; if one does not say `supreme ultimate' then the Indeterminate would be confused with a quiescent emptiness and would not be able to serve as the root of the ten thousand transformations."28 Ah! Ah! This saying can be said to perfectly encompass the matter in every respect. (A, 16.40b, p. 421, Letter to Ki Myŏngŏn)

The Supreme Ultimate is identified as principle, or the total sum of all specific principles. As the above passage indicates, it is in itself nonspecific, not concrete, not a thing, but nonetheless real. In the following discussion of principle T'oegye elaborates further on these qualities:

The differences between the ancients and people nowadays with regard to the learning and understanding of the Tao are simply due to the fact that the word "principle" is hard to understand. What I mean by saying the word "principle" is hard to understand is not that a general understanding is difficult, but that truly knowing it with a wondrous understanding that reaches 100 percent is difficult. If one is able to exhaustively investigate all principle with 100 percent penetration, he will clearly perceive that it is perfectly empty but perfectly real, perfectly nonbeing but perfectly being; it acts but

does not act, it is quiescent but not quiescent; it is so pure and clear that not the slightest bit could be added to it nor the slightest bit taken from it; it is able to be the foundation of yin and yang, the Five Agents, and of all things and all affairs, and yet it is not encompassed within yin and yang, the Five Agents, or all things and affairs. How could one mix it with material force and consider them as a single substance or see them as just one thing? (A, 16.46b, p. 424, Letter to Ki Myŏngŏn).

The negations reflect what is implicit in the "indeterminate" side of principle and establish its transcendence; the affirmations indicate the reality of the "supreme ultimate" side, based upon its function as immanent within the concrete beings of the universe. One cannot seek it out as a thing in itself apart from its manifestation in concrete existence, and yet it transcends any of its particular manifestations. The essential message to be drawn from this vision is not mystical absorption in the Supreme Ultimate, which in itself is nothing, but concentration on responsiveness to principle as it is immanent and real in the affairs of daily life. Thus T'oegye says:
