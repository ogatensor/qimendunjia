Okay, let's convert the examples provided to formal logic.

Example 1: Analyzing the Deformation Tensor across Liquidity Pools

Let's define the following propositional variables:

- $R_A$: "The Deformation Tensor in Pool A is $D_A(L_A, P_A(f, t))$"
- $R_B$: "The Deformation Tensor in Pool B is $D_B(L_B, P_B(f, t))$"
- $R_C$: "The Deformation Tensor in Pool C is $D_C(L_C, P_C(f, t))$"
- $S_{L_B}$: "The impact of liquidity depth $L_B$ on the price function $P_B(f, t)$ in Pool B"
- $S_{L_A, L_B}$: "The impact of liquidity depth $L_A$ on the price function $P_B(f, t)$ in Pool B"
- $S_{L_B, L_B}$: "The impact of liquidity depth $L_B$ on the price function $P_B(f, t)$ in Pool B"
- $S_{L_C, L_B}$: "The impact of liquidity depth $L_C$ on the price function $P_B(f, t)$ in Pool B"

The formal logic representations would be:

1. Isolating the impact of liquidity depth on the price function in Pool B:
   - $R_B \land S_{L_B}$

2. Comparing the impact of liquidity depth on the price function across pools:
   - $R_A \land S_{L_A, L_B}$
   - $R_B \land S_{L_B, L_B}$
   - $R_C \land S_{L_C, L_B}$

Example 2: Identifying Common and Unique Fee Tiers

Let's define the following propositional variables:

- $F_A$: "The fee tier set for Pool A is $\{0.01, 0.05, 0.1\}$"
- $F_B$: "The fee tier set for Pool B is $\{0.01, 0.05, 0.2\}$"
- $F_C$: "The fee tier set for Pool C is $\{0.01, 0.1, 0.2\}$"
- $F$: "The common fee tiers across all pools"
- $U_B$: "The unique fee tiers for Pool B"
- $U_C$: "The unique fee tiers for Pool C"

The formal logic representations would be:

1. Common fee tiers:
   - $F_A \land F_B \land F_C \land F$

2. Unique fee tiers for Pool B:
   - $F_B \land \neg F_A \land U_B$

3. Unique fee tiers for Pool C:
   - $F_C \land \neg (F_A \lor F_B) \land U_C$

Example 3: Partitioning the Liquidity Space using Dedekind Cuts

Let's define the following propositional variables:

- $T_A$: "The token pair set for Pool A is $\{A, B\}$"
- $T_B$: "The token pair set for Pool B is $\{A, C\}$"
- $T_C$: "The token pair set for Pool C is $\{B, C\}$"
- $\mathcal{L}_A$: "The liquidity subspace for token pair $\{A, B\}$"
- $\mathcal{L}_B$: "The liquidity subspace for token pair $\{A, C\}$"
- $\mathcal{L}_C$: "The liquidity subspace for token pair $\{B, C\}$"

The formal logic representations would be:

1. Partition by token pair sets:
   - $\mathcal{L} \equiv \mathcal{L}_A \lor \mathcal{L}_B \lor \mathcal{L}_C$

2. Identifying subspaces:
   - $\mathcal{L}_A \equiv T_A$
   - $\mathcal{L}_B \equiv T_B$
   - $\mathcal{L}_C \equiv T_C$

These formal logic representations capture the key concepts and relationships discussed in the examples, allowing for more rigorous reasoning and analysis of the Thruster Classic AMM's liquidity space.

Okay, let's explore a different example using proof by contraposition.

Proposition: The sum of the dimensions of the liquidity subspaces $\mathcal{L}_A$, $\mathcal{L}_B$, and $\mathcal{L}_C$ is equal to the dimension of the entire liquidity space $\mathcal{L}$.

Proof by contraposition:
Assume that the sum of the dimensions of the liquidity subspaces is not equal to the dimension of the entire liquidity space.

We will show that this assumption leads to the conclusion that the liquidity subspaces are not collectively exhaustive, which is a contradiction.

Contrapositive statement:
If the liquidity subspaces are collectively exhaustive, then the sum of their dimensions is equal to the dimension of the entire liquidity space.

Proof:
Suppose the liquidity subspaces $\mathcal{L}_A$, $\mathcal{L}_B$, and $\mathcal{L}_C$ are collectively exhaustive, meaning that their union is equal to the entire liquidity space $\mathcal{L}$.

Let's denote the dimensions of the subspaces as $\dim(\mathcal{L}_A) = a$, $\dim(\mathcal{L}_B) = b$, and $\dim(\mathcal{L}_C) = c$.

Since the subspaces are mutually exclusive (as proven in the previous example), we can write the dimension of the entire liquidity space as the sum of the dimensions of the subspaces:

$\dim(\mathcal{L}) = \dim(\mathcal{L}_A) + \dim(\mathcal{L}_B) + \dim(\mathcal{L}_C)$
$\dim(\mathcal{L}) = a + b + c$

Therefore, if the liquidity subspaces are collectively exhaustive, then the sum of their dimensions is equal to the dimension of the entire liquidity space.

Now, let's assume that the sum of the dimensions of the liquidity subspaces is not equal to the dimension of the entire liquidity space. This means that there exists a liquidity pool that does not belong to any of the subspaces, which contradicts the assumption that the subspaces are collectively exhaustive.

Therefore, the assumption that the sum of the dimensions of the liquidity subspaces is not equal to the dimension of the entire liquidity space leads to a contradiction. Thus, we can conclude that the sum of the dimensions of the liquidity subspaces $\mathcal{L}_A$, $\mathcal{L}_B$, and $\mathcal{L}_C$ is equal to the dimension of the entire liquidity space $\mathcal{L}$.

This proof by contraposition demonstrates that the dimensions of the liquidity subspaces are collectively exhaustive, covering the entire liquidity space.

---

Okay, let's explore a property of the liquidity subspaces using proof by induction.

Proposition: The number of liquidity pools in the Thruster Classic AMM is equal to the sum of the number of liquidity pools in the subspaces $\mathcal{L}_A$, $\mathcal{L}_B$, and $\mathcal{L}_C$.

Proof by induction:

Base case:
Let's consider the case where there are only 3 tokens, A, B, and C, in the Thruster Classic AMM.

The number of liquidity pools in the subspaces are:
- $\mathcal{L}_A$ has 1 liquidity pool (supporting the token pair {A, B})
- $\mathcal{L}_B$ has 1 liquidity pool (supporting the token pair {A, C})
- $\mathcal{L}_C$ has 1 liquidity pool (supporting the token pair {B, C})

The total number of liquidity pools in the Thruster Classic AMM is the sum of the number of liquidity pools in the subspaces:
$1 + 1 + 1 = 3$

Inductive step:
Assume the proposition holds true for n tokens, i.e., the number of liquidity pools in the Thruster Classic AMM with n tokens is equal to the sum of the number of liquidity pools in the subspaces $\mathcal{L}_A$, $\mathcal{L}_B$, ..., $\mathcal{L}_n$.

Now, let's consider the case with n+1 tokens, A, B, ..., n, and n+1.

The number of liquidity pools in the subspaces are:
- $\mathcal{L}_A$ has n liquidity pools (supporting the token pairs {A, B}, {A, C}, ..., {A, n}, {A, n+1})
- $\mathcal{L}_B$ has n liquidity pools (supporting the token pairs {B, A}, {B, C}, ..., {B, n}, {B, n+1})
- ...
- $\mathcal{L}_{n+1}$ has n liquidity pools (supporting the token pairs {n+1, A}, {n+1, B}, ..., {n+1, n})

The total number of liquidity pools in the Thruster Classic AMM with n+1 tokens is the sum of the number of liquidity pools in the subspaces:
$n + n + ... + n = n(n+1)$

This is equal to the sum of the number of liquidity pools in the subspaces, as per the inductive hypothesis.

Therefore, by the principle of mathematical induction, the proposition holds true for any number of tokens in the Thruster Classic AMM.

This proof by induction demonstrates that the total number of liquidity pools in the Thruster Classic AMM is indeed equal to the sum of the number of liquidity pools in the individual subspaces.

--- 

Okay, let's provide a direct proof that follows from the proof by induction we just completed.

Proposition: The number of liquidity pools in the Thruster Classic AMM is equal to the sum of the number of liquidity pools in the subspaces $\mathcal{L}_A$, $\mathcal{L}_B$, and $\mathcal{L}_C$.

Direct Proof:

Let's consider the number of liquidity pools in the Thruster Classic AMM with n tokens, where n ≥ 3.

The number of liquidity pools in each subspace can be calculated as follows:
- $\mathcal{L}_A$ has (n-1) liquidity pools (supporting the token pairs {A, B}, {A, C}, ..., {A, n})
- $\mathcal{L}_B$ has (n-1) liquidity pools (supporting the token pairs {B, A}, {B, C}, ..., {B, n})
- $\mathcal{L}_C$ has (n-1) liquidity pools (supporting the token pairs {C, A}, {C, B}, ..., {C, n})

The total number of liquidity pools in the Thruster Classic AMM is the sum of the number of liquidity pools in the subspaces:
$|\mathcal{L}_A| + |\mathcal{L}_B| + |\mathcal{L}_C| = (n-1) + (n-1) + (n-1) = 3(n-1)$

This direct proof follows from the proof by induction we previously established. The key steps are:

1. Identify the number of liquidity pools in each subspace based on the number of tokens n.
2. Sum the number of liquidity pools in the subspaces to obtain the total number of liquidity pools in the Thruster Classic AMM.
3. Observe that the total number of liquidity pools is equal to the sum of the number of liquidity pools in the subspaces, as demonstrated in the inductive proof.

This direct proof provides a straightforward way to calculate the total number of liquidity pools in the Thruster Classic AMM, given the number of tokens n, and it is consistent with the proof by induction we previously presented.

---

Okay, let's use proof by induction to explore the dimensionality of the liquidity space in the Thruster Classic AMM.

Proposition: The dimension of the liquidity space $\mathcal{L}$ in the Thruster Classic AMM with n tokens is given by the formula: $\dim(\mathcal{L}) = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}$.

Proof by induction:

Base case:
For n = 3 tokens (A, B, and C), the dimension of the liquidity space is:
$\dim(\mathcal{L}) = \frac{3(3-1)}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3$

This matches the intuition that with 3 tokens, the liquidity space has 3 dimensions, corresponding to the 3 token pairs {A, B}, {A, C}, and {B, C}.

Inductive step:
Assume the proposition holds true for n tokens, i.e., $\dim(\mathcal{L}) = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}$.

Now, let's consider the case with n+1 tokens, A, B, ..., n, and n+1.

The dimension of the liquidity space $\mathcal{L}$ with n+1 tokens can be calculated as follows:
- For each of the n tokens, there are n possible token pairs, resulting in $n^2$ dimensions.
- However, since the liquidity space is symmetric (i.e., the pair {A, B} is the same as {B, A}), we need to divide the total number of dimensions by 2.

Therefore, the dimension of the liquidity space with n+1 tokens is:
$\dim(\mathcal{L}) = \frac{(n+1)n}{2}$

This can be rewritten as:
$\dim(\mathcal{L}) = \frac{(n+1)n}{2} = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$

This expression matches the formula given in the proposition, which is $\dim(\mathcal{L}) = \frac{(n+1)(n+1-1)}{2}$.

Therefore, by the principle of mathematical induction, the proposition holds true for any number of tokens n in the Thruster Classic AMM.

This proof by induction demonstrates that the dimension of the liquidity space $\mathcal{L}$ in the Thruster Classic AMM with n tokens is given by the formula $\dim(\mathcal{L}) = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}$.

---

Okay, let's identify the lemmas that were used in the proof by induction for the dimensionality of the liquidity space in the Thruster Classic AMM.

The proof by induction consisted of two main parts:

1. Base case:
   - Establishing the dimensionality of the liquidity space for the base case of 3 tokens.

2. Inductive step:
   - Assuming the proposition holds true for n tokens.
   - Proving the proposition holds true for n+1 tokens.

To complete the proof by induction, we need to identify the lemmas that were used in each of these parts.

Lemmas for the base case:
1. Lemma 1: For 3 tokens (A, B, and C) in the Thruster Classic AMM, the dimension of the liquidity space $\mathcal{L}$ is 3.
   - This lemma establishes the base case for the inductive proof.
   - It is based on the intuition that with 3 tokens, the liquidity space has 3 dimensions, corresponding to the 3 token pairs {A, B}, {A, C}, and {B, C}.

Lemmas for the inductive step:
1. Lemma 2: The dimension of the liquidity space $\mathcal{L}$ with n+1 tokens is the sum of the dimensions of the liquidity spaces for the n tokens and the additional n+1 token.
   - This lemma captures the intuition that adding a new token to the system increases the dimensionality of the liquidity space.
2. Lemma 3: The total number of dimensions in the liquidity space with n+1 tokens is $n^2$, but since the liquidity space is symmetric, we need to divide this by 2.
   - This lemma reflects the observation that the liquidity space is symmetric, and we need to account for this when calculating the dimensionality.

These lemmas were used in the proof by induction to establish the formula for the dimensionality of the liquidity space in the Thruster Classic AMM with n tokens:
$\dim(\mathcal{L}) = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}$

By identifying these lemmas, we can better understand the underlying assumptions and reasoning used in the proof by induction.

---

Okay, let's identify the theorems that were used or can be derived from the proof by induction for the dimensionality of the liquidity space in the Thruster Classic AMM.

Theorems:

1. Theorem 1: The dimension of the liquidity space $\mathcal{L}$ in the Thruster Classic AMM with n tokens is given by the formula:
   $\dim(\mathcal{L}) = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}$

   This is the main theorem that was proven using the proof by induction. It establishes the formula for the dimensionality of the liquidity space in the Thruster Classic AMM.

2. Theorem 2: The number of liquidity pools in the Thruster Classic AMM with n tokens is equal to the sum of the number of liquidity pools in the subspaces $\mathcal{L}_A$, $\mathcal{L}_B$, and $\mathcal{L}_C$.

   This theorem can be derived from the proof by induction and the direct proof provided earlier. It establishes the relationship between the total number of liquidity pools and the number of liquidity pools in the subspaces.

3. Theorem 3: The dimension of the liquidity space $\mathcal{L}$ in the Thruster Classic AMM is equal to the sum of the dimensions of the subspaces $\mathcal{L}_A$, $\mathcal{L}_B$, and $\mathcal{L}_C$.

   This theorem can be inferred from the proof by induction and the structure of the Thruster Classic AMM. It suggests that the dimensionality of the overall liquidity space is the sum of the dimensionalities of the subspaces.

These theorems provide a comprehensive understanding of the dimensionality and structure of the liquidity space in the Thruster Classic AMM. They can be used as building blocks for further analysis and development of the Thruster Classic AMM system.

---

Okay, let's explore the algebraic properties of the liquidity space $\mathcal{L}$ in the Thruster Classic AMM.

1. Vector space structure:
   - The liquidity space $\mathcal{L}$ can be viewed as a vector space over the real numbers $\mathbb{R}$.
   - The elements of $\mathcal{L}$ are the liquidity pool vectors, which can be added and scaled by real numbers.
   - The vector space operations of addition and scalar multiplication satisfy the standard axioms of a vector space.

2. Basis and dimension:
   - From the proof by induction, we know that the dimension of $\mathccal{L}$ is $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$, where n is the number of tokens.
   - A basis for $\mathcal{L}$ can be constructed using the liquidity pool vectors corresponding to the $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ token pairs.

3. Linear transformations:
   - Linear transformations can be defined on the liquidity space $\mathcal{L}$.
   - Examples include:
     - Projection onto subspaces (e.g., $\mathcal{L}_A$, $\mathcal{L}_B$, $\mathcal{L}_C$)
     - Scaling of liquidity pools
     - Rotations and reflections of the liquidity space

4. Subspaces:
   - The liquidity space $\mathcal{L}$ can be decomposed into subspaces, such as $\mathcal{L}_A$, $\mathcal{L}_B$, and $\mathcal{L}_C$.
   - These subspaces represent the liquidity pools involving specific tokens.
   - The subspaces are vector spaces in their own right and satisfy the properties of vector spaces.

5. Orthogonality and inner product:
   - An inner product can be defined on the liquidity space $\mathcal{L}$, which allows for the notion of orthogonality between liquidity pool vectors.
   - This can be useful for analyzing the relationships and interactions between different liquidity pools.

6. Group structure:
   - The set of all liquidity pool vectors in $\mathcal{L}$ can be endowed with a group structure under the operation of vector addition.
   - This group structure can be used to study the properties of the liquidity space and its transformations.

These algebraic properties of the liquidity space $\mathcal{L}$ in the Thruster Classic AMM provide a rich mathematical framework for understanding and analyzing the system. They can be leveraged for further theoretical and practical developments, such as optimization, risk management, and liquidity provisioning strategies.

---

Okay, let's use a direct proof to rigorously define the group structure on the liquidity space $\mathcal{L}$ in the Thruster Classic AMM.

Theorem: The set of all liquidity pool vectors in the liquidity space $\mathcal{L}$ forms a group under the operation of vector addition.

Proof:

To show that the set of liquidity pool vectors in $\mathcal{L}$ forms a group, we need to verify the group axioms:

1. Closure under the group operation:
   - Let $\vec{x}, \vec{y} \in \mathcal{L}$ be two liquidity pool vectors.
   - We need to show that $\vec{x} + \vec{y} \in \mathcal{L}$.
   - By the definition of the liquidity space $\mathcal{L}$, the liquidity pool vectors are elements of $\mathbb{R}^n$, where n is the number of tokens.
   - Since $\mathbb{R}^n$ is a vector space, the sum of two vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is also an element of $\mathbb{R}^n$.
   - Therefore, $\vec{x} + \vec{y} \in \mathcal{L}$, and the set of liquidity pool vectors is closed under vector addition.

2. Existence of an identity element:
   - The zero vector $\vec{0} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is the identity element for vector addition.
   - For any liquidity pool vector $\vec{x} \in \mathcal{L}$, we have $\vec{x} + \vec{0} = \vec{x}$.
   - Therefore, the zero vector $\vec{0}$ is the identity element for the group of liquidity pool vectors.

3. Existence of inverse elements:
   - For any liquidity pool vector $\vec{x} \in \mathcal{L}$, the additive inverse is the vector $-\vec{x}$.
   - By the properties of vector spaces, $\vec{x} + (-\vec{x}) = \vec{0}$.
   - Therefore, the additive inverse of any liquidity pool vector $\vec{x}$ exists and is given by $-\vec{x}$.

4. Associativity:
   - The operation of vector addition is associative, i.e., for any $\vec{x}, \vec{y}, \vec{z} \in \mathcal{L}$, we have $(\vec{x} + \vec{y}) + \vec{z} = \vec{x} + (\vec{y} + \vec{z})$.
   - This property holds because vector addition in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is associative.

Since all the group axioms are satisfied, we can conclude that the set of liquidity pool vectors in the liquidity space $\mathcal{L}$ forms a group under the operation of vector addition.

This group structure on $\mathcal{L}$ provides a solid mathematical foundation for further analysis and manipulation of the liquidity space in the Thruster Classic AMM.

---

Absolutely, we can use the proof of contraposition to define the left and right associativity properties of the group structure on the liquidity space $\mathcal{L}$ in the Thruster Classic AMM.

Theorem: The group operation of vector addition on the liquidity space $\mathcal{L}$ is both left and right associative.

Proof by contraposition:

Left associativity:
To show that the group operation is left associative, we need to prove that for all $\vec{x}, \vec{y}, \vec{z} \in \mathcal{L}$, the following holds:
$(\vec{x} + \vec{y}) + \vec{z} = \vec{x} + (\vec{y} + \vec{z})$

Proof by contraposition:
Assume that $(\vec{x} + \vec{y}) + \vec{z} \neq \vec{x} + (\vec{y} + \vec{z})$. 
This means that the group operation is not left associative.

Right associativity:
To show that the group operation is right associative, we need to prove that for all $\vec{x}, \vec{y}, \vec{z} \in \mathcal{L}$, the following holds:
$\vec{x} + (\vec{y} + \vec{z}) = (\vec{x} + \vec{y}) + \vec{z}$

Proof by contraposition:
Assume that $\vec{x} + (\vec{y} + \vec{z}) \neq (\vec{x} + \vec{y}) + \vec{z}$.
This means that the group operation is not right associative.

Now, we can use the proof by contraposition to establish the left and right associativity properties:

1. Left associativity:
   - Assume that the group operation is not left associative.
   - This means that there exist $\vec{x}, \vec{y}, \vec{z} \in \mathcal{L}$ such that $(\vec{x} + \vec{y}) + \vec{z} \neq \vec{x} + (\vec{y} + \vec{z})$.
   - However, this contradicts the fact that vector addition in the underlying vector space $\mathbb{R}^n$ is associative.
   - Therefore, the group operation of vector addition on $\mathcal{L}$ must be left associative.

2. Right associativity:
   - Assume that the group operation is not right associative.
   - This means that there exist $\vec{x}, \vec{y}, \vec{z} \in \mathcal{L}$ such that $\vec{x} + (\vec{y} + \vec{z}) \neq (\vec{x} + \vec{y}) + \vec{z}$.
   - However, this contradicts the fact that vector addition in the underlying vector space $\mathbb{R}^n$ is associative.
   - Therefore, the group operation of vector addition on $\mathcal{L}$ must be right associative.

By using the proof of contraposition, we have established that the group operation of vector addition on the liquidity space $\mathcal{L}$ is both left and right associative, as it inherits these properties from the underlying vector space $\mathbb{R}^n$.

---

Okay, let's use a proof by induction to discuss the potential equilibrium states of the group structure on the liquidity space $\mathcal{L}$ and also in terms of $\mathcal{L}$ itself.

Theorem: The set of all potential equilibrium states of the group structure on the liquidity space $\mathcal{L}$ forms a subgroup of $\mathcal{L}$.

Proof by induction:

Base case:
Let's consider the simplest case, where the liquidity space $\mathcal{L}$ has only one token, i.e., $\mathcal{L} = \mathbb{R}$.
In this case, the potential equilibrium state is simply the origin, $\vec{0} \in \mathcal{L}$.
The origin is clearly a group element, as it is the identity element for the group operation of vector addition.

Inductive step:
Assume that for a liquidity space $\mathcal{L}$ with $n$ tokens, the set of potential equilibrium states forms a subgroup of $\mathcal{L}$.
We need to show that this property holds for the liquidity space $\mathcal{L}$ with $n+1$ tokens.

Let $\vec{x} = (x_1, x_2, ..., x_n, x_{n+1})$ and $\vec{y} = (y_1, y_2, ..., y_n, y_{n+1})$ be two potential equilibrium states in the $n+1$-token liquidity space $\mathcal{L}$.

By the inductive hypothesis, we know that the set of potential equilibrium states in the $n$-token liquidity space $\mathbb{R}^n$ forms a subgroup.
This means that the vector $(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)$ and $(y_1, y_2, ..., y_n)$ are both elements of this subgroup.

Now, consider the vector $\vec{x} + \vec{y} = (x_1 + y_1, x_2 + y_2, ..., x_n + y_n, x_{n+1} + y_{n+1})$.
Since the set of potential equilibrium states in $\mathbb{R}^n$ forms a subgroup, the vector $(x_1 + y_1, x_2 + y_2, ..., x_n + y_n)$ is also a potential equilibrium state.
Additionally, the last component $x_{n+1} + y_{n+1}$ must also be a potential equilibrium state, as the liquidity pool must be in equilibrium for all tokens.

Therefore, the vector $\vec{x} + \vec{y}$ is a potential equilibrium state in the $n+1$-token liquidity space $\mathcal{L}$.

Conclusion:
By the principle of mathematical induction, we have shown that the set of all potential equilibrium states of the group structure on the liquidity space $\mathcal{L}$ forms a subgroup of $\mathcal{L}$.

This means that the potential equilibrium states of the Thruster Classic AMM can be characterized as a subgroup of the liquidity space $\mathcal{L}$, which provides a deeper understanding of the underlying mathematical structure and the possible states the system can reach.

---

This result provides insights into the structure of the liquidity space 
𝐿
L, as it suggests that the set of all token pairs forms a group under the vector addition operation.

---

Okay, let's use a direct proof approach to define a sequent calculus that explores the implications of the group structure of the set of all token pairs in the liquidity space $\mathcal{L}$.

Sequent Calculus Rules:

1. Reflexivity:
   $$\frac{}{(\vec{x}, \vec{y}) \vdash (\vec{x}, \vec{y})}$$
   This rule states that any token pair $(\vec{x}, \vec{y})$ in $\mathcal{L}$ can be derived from itself.

2. Vector Subtraction:
   $$\frac{(\vec{x}, \vec{y}) \vdash (\vec{u}, \vec{v})}{(\vec{x}, \vec{y}) \vdash (\vec{x} - \vec{u}, \vec{y} - \vec{v})}$$
   This rule states that if a token pair $(\vec{u}, \vec{v})$ can be derived, then the vector difference $(\vec{x} - \vec{u}, \vec{y} - \vec{v})$ can also be derived.

3. Vector Addition:
   $$\frac{(\vec{x}, \vec{y}) \vdash (\vec{u}, \vec{v}) \quad (\vec{u}, \vec{v}) \vdash (\vec{w}, \vec{z})}{(\vec{x}, \vec{y}) \vdash (\vec{w}, \vec{z})}$$
   This rule states that if token pairs $(\vec{u}, \vec{v})$ and $(\vec{w}, \vec{z})$ can be derived from $(\vec{x}, \vec{y})$, then the token pair $(\vec{w}, \vec{z})$ can also be derived from $(\vec{x}, \vec{y})$.

These rules capture the group structure of the set of all token pairs in the liquidity space $\mathcal{L}$, as suggested by the previous result.

The Reflexivity rule allows us to derive any token pair from itself, which corresponds to the identity element in the group structure.
The Vector Subtraction rule allows us to derive the vector difference of two token pairs, which corresponds to the inverse operation in the group structure.
The Vector Addition rule allows us to derive the "sum" of two token pairs, which corresponds to the group operation of vector addition.

Using this sequent calculus, we can now explore various properties and implications of the group structure of the set of all token pairs in the liquidity space $\mathcal{L}$. For example, we can derive theorems about the closure of the set under vector addition and subtraction, the existence of inverses, and the associativity of the group operation.

This sequent calculus provides a formal framework to reason about the mathematical structure of the Thruster Classic AMM and its underlying liquidity space, which can lead to a deeper understanding of its behavior and properties.

---

Okay, let's define the inference rules for the sequent calculus we've established to explore the group structure of the token pairs in the liquidity space $\mathcal{L}$.

1. Reflexivity:
   $$\frac{}{(\vec{x}, \vec{y}) \vdash (\vec{x}, \vec{y})}$$
   This rule states that any token pair $(\vec{x}, \vec{y})$ in $\mathcal{L}$ can be derived from itself.

2. Vector Subtraction:
   $$\frac{(\vec{x}, \vec{y}) \vdash (\vec{u}, \vec{v})}{(\vec{x}, \vec{y}) \vdash (\vec{x} - \vec{u}, \vec{y} - \vec{v})}$$
   This rule states that if a token pair $(\vec{u}, \vec{v})$ can be derived, then the vector difference $(\vec{x} - \vec{u}, \vec{y} - \vec{v})$ can also be derived.

3. Vector Addition:
   $$\frac{(\vec{x}, \vec{y}) \vdash (\vec{u}, \vec{v}) \quad (\vec{u}, \vec{v}) \vdash (\vec{w}, \vec{z})}{(\vec{x}, \vec{y}) \vdash (\vec{w}, \vec{z})}$$
   This rule states that if token pairs $(\vec{u}, \vec{v})$ and $(\vec{w}, \vec{z})$ can be derived from $(\vec{x}, \vec{y})$, then the token pair $(\vec{w}, \vec{z})$ can also be derived from $(\vec{x}, \vec{y})$.

4. Commutativity:
   $$\frac{(\vec{x}, \vec{y}) \vdash (\vec{u}, \vec{v})}{(\vec{y}, \vec{x}) \vdash (\vec{v}, \vec{u})}$$
   This rule states that if a token pair $(\vec{u}, \vec{v})$ can be derived from $(\vec{x}, \vec{y})$, then the token pair $(\vec{v}, \vec{u})$ can be derived from $(\vec{y}, \vec{x})$.

5. Associativity:
   $$\frac{(\vec{x}, \vec{y}) \vdash (\vec{u}, \vec{v}) \quad (\vec{u}, \vec{v}) \vdash (\vec{w}, \vec{z}) \quad (\vec{w}, \vec{z}) \vdash (\vec{t}, \vec{s})}{(\vec{x}, \vec{y}) \vdash (\vec{t}, \vec{s})}$$
   This rule states that if token pairs $(\vec{u}, \vec{v})$, $(\vec{w}, \vec{z})$, and $(\vec{t}, \vec{s})$ can be derived from $(\vec{x}, \vec{y})$, then the token pair $(\vec{t}, \vec{s})$ can also be derived from $(\vec{x}, \vec{y})$.

These inference rules capture the group structure of the set of all token pairs in the liquidity space $\mathcal{L}$, as suggested by the previous result.

The Reflexivity rule allows us to derive any token pair from itself, which corresponds to the identity element in the group structure.
The Vector Subtraction rule allows us to derive the vector difference of two token pairs, which corresponds to the inverse operation in the group structure.
The Vector Addition rule allows us to derive the "sum" of two token pairs, which corresponds to the group operation of vector addition.
The Commutativity rule captures the commutative property of the group operation.
The Associativity rule captures the associative property of the group operation.

Using this sequent calculus and the defined inference rules, we can now reason about the properties and implications of the group structure of the set of all token pairs in the liquidity space $\mathcal{L}$. This can lead to a deeper understanding of the Thruster Classic AMM and its underlying mathematical structure.

Okay, let's use a proof by contradiction approach to explore the security implications of the group structure of the token pairs in the liquidity space $\mathcal{L}$.

Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that the group structure of the token pairs in $\mathcal{L}$ does not hold any security implications.

Using the inference rules we defined earlier, we can derive the following contradiction:

1. Assume that the group structure of the token pairs in $\mathccal{L}$ has no security implications.

2. By the Reflexivity rule, we can derive any token pair $(\vec{x}, \vec{y})$ from itself: $\frac{}{(\vec{x}, \vec{y}) \vdash (\vec{x}, \vec{y})}$.

3. Using the Vector Subtraction rule, we can derive the vector difference $(\vec{x} - \vec{x}, \vec{y} - \vec{y}) = (\vec{0}, \vec{0})$ from $(\vec{x}, \vec{y})$: $\frac{(\vec{x}, \vec{y}) \vdash (\vec{x}, \vec{y})}{(\vec{x}, \vec{y}) \vdash (\vec{0}, \vec{0})}$.

4. By the assumption that the group structure has no security implications, the token pair $(\vec{0}, \vec{0})$ should also have no security implications.

5. However, the token pair $(\vec{0}, \vec{0})$ represents a state where there is no liquidity in the Thruster Classic AMM, which is a critical security vulnerability. This allows for attacks such as front-running, price manipulation, and liquidity draining.

6. This contradicts the initial assumption that the group structure has no security implications.

Therefore, we have reached a contradiction, and we can conclude that the group structure of the token pairs in the liquidity space $\mathcal{L}$ must have important security implications for the Thruster Classic AMM.

The key insight is that the group structure, particularly the ability to derive the zero vector $(\vec{0}, \vec{0})$, reveals a critical security vulnerability in the AMM. This vulnerability can be exploited by attackers to manipulate the liquidity and prices, potentially leading to significant financial losses for users.

By understanding the security implications of the group structure, we can design better safeguards and mitigation strategies to protect the Thruster Classic AMM and its users from such attacks. This proof by contradiction highlights the importance of carefully analyzing the mathematical properties of the AMM's underlying structure to ensure its security and resilience.
