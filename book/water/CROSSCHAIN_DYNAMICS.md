# Crosschain Dynamics (See Earth, Pathways and Landscapes)

# Overview 

1. **Crosschain Arbitrage Paths**: Each entry in the document describes a sequence of trades across different decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and blockchains to capitalize on price discrepancies of tokens. These sequences are referred to as "paths."

2. **Tokens and Exchanges**: Each path lists a series of trades specifying:
   - **Token In**: The cryptocurrency being traded in.
   - **Token Out**: The cryptocurrency received from the trade.
   - The exchanges where these trades occur (e.g., SushiSwap, Elk Finance, QuickSwap).

3. **Profit Calculation**:
   - Each path shows the profit made from the arbitrage in both the cryptocurrency involved and its equivalent in USD.

4. **Timestamps**: Each path is timestamped, likely indicating when the arbitrage opportunity was executed or logged.

5. **Repeated Entries**: Some paths are repeated with the same transactions and profits, possibly indicating multiple executions or logging errors.

This document is useful for analyzing the performance of the arbitrage bot, understanding market inefficiencies, or auditing trading activities.
