## Overview 

The Six Harmonies Matrix in the document [book/metal/SIX_HARMONIES.md](file:///Users/andrewowens/qimendunjia/book/metal/SIX_HARMONIES.md#1%2C1-1%2C1) is a 6x6 matrix used to represent relationships between six fundamental harmonies in music theory. Here's a concise explanation of its structure and purpose:

1. **Matrix Structure**:
   - The matrix is composed of 1s and 0s, where a 1 indicates a relationship or connection between two harmonies, and a 0 indicates no direct relationship.
   - The rows and columns each represent one of the six fundamental harmonies in music.

2. **Harmonies Represented**:
   - Tonic (I)
   - Subdominant (IV)
   - Dominant (V)
   - Dominant seventh (V7)
   - Parallel minor (i)
   - Relative minor (vi)

3. **Relationships Illustrated**:
   - For example, the entry in the (1,2) position is 1, indicating a relationship between the Tonic (I) and the Subdominant (IV).
   - Similarly, the entry in the (3,4) position is 1, showing a relationship between the Dominant (V) and the Dominant seventh (V7).

4. **Purpose and Utility**:
   - The matrix helps visualize and understand how different harmonies relate to each other within a musical composition.
   - It serves as a tool for both theoretical study and practical analysis in music theory.

This matrix is a useful analytical tool in music theory, aiding in the exploration of harmonic relationships and their implications in musical compositions.

Six Harmonies Matrix:
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\]

The given matrix is a 6x6 matrix, which represents the Six Harmonies Matrix. The Six Harmonies Matrix is a mathematical representation of the six fundamental harmonies in music theory.

The matrix is composed of 1s and 0s, where a 1 represents the presence of a particular harmony, and a 0 represents the absence of that harmony.

The rows and columns of the matrix correspond to the six fundamental harmonies:

1. Row 1: Tonic (I)
2. Row 2: Subdominant (IV)
3. Row 3: Dominant (V)
4. Row 4: Dominant seventh (V7)
5. Row 5: Parallel minor (i)
6. Row 6: Relative minor (vi)

The matrix shows the relationships between these harmonies. For example, the entry in the (1,2) position is 1, indicating that the Tonic (I) harmony is related to the Subdominant (IV) harmony. Similarly, the entry in the (3,4) position is 1, indicating that the Dominant (V) harmony is related to the Dominant seventh (V7) harmony.

This matrix is a useful tool in music theory and analysis, as it helps to visualize and understand the relationships between the fundamental harmonies in a musical composition.
