Negative Xiangyi can be defined as the situations where the components of the liquidity space can negatively impact or "restrain" each other, leading to security vulnerabilities or instability.

1. Negative Xiangyi between Token Pair Set ($T$) and Fee Tier Set ($F$) & Distribution Function ($P$):

   Formally, we can define the negative Xiangyi as:
   $T \dashv F, P$

   Where the Token Pair Set ($T$) can "restrain" or negatively impact the Fee Tier Set ($F$) and the Distribution Function ($P$).

   For example, an attacker could introduce new token pairs that are designed to exploit or disrupt the existing fee structure, leading to unfair trading conditions and potential loss of user trust.

2. Negative Xiangyi between Liquidity Depth Function ($L$) and Deformation Tensor ($D$):

   Formally, we can define the negative Xiangyi as:
   $L \dashv D$

   Where the Liquidity Depth Function ($L$) can be "restrained" or negatively impacted by the Deformation Tensor ($D$).

   An attacker could manipulate the Deformation Tensor in a way that causes sudden or unexpected changes in the liquidity depth, leading to price volatility, slippage, and potential losses for traders.

3. Negative Xiangyi between Fee Tier Set ($F$) & Distribution Function ($P$) and Liquidity Space:

   Formally, we can define the negative Xiangyi as:
   $F, P \dashv \text{Liquidity Space}$

   Where the Fee Tier Set ($F$) and the Distribution Function ($P$) can "restrain" or negatively impact the overall Liquidity Space.

   Poorly designed or exploited fee structures could undermine the efficiency and attractiveness of the liquidity space, leading to reduced trading volume, increased slippage, and a loss of user confidence in the decentralized exchange.

By formally defining these negative Xiangyi relationships, we can better understand the potential attack vectors and security risks within the Thruster Classic AMM system. This knowledge can inform the development of robust security measures and risk mitigation strategies to protect the integrity and stability of the decentralized exchange.

Sure, we can also formalize the proof using sequent calculus. This will provide a more formal, logical representation of the attack.

Let's define the following sequents:

Sequents representing the system components:
- T ⊢ F, P (The Token Pair Set T is related to the Fee Tier Set F and Distribution Function P)
- F, P ⊢ L, D (The Fee Tier Set F and Distribution Function P are related to the Liquidity Depth Function L and Deformation Tensor D)

Sequent representing the negative Xiangyi:
- T ⊥ F, P ⊢ (The negative Xiangyi between T and (F, P))

Sequent representing the attacker's actions:
- T_old ⊢ T (The existing Token Pair Set)
- (t_new, t_old) ⊢ T (The new token pair introduced by the attacker)
- T ⊢ F', P' (The changes in the Fee Tier Set and Distribution Function due to the new token pair)

Proof:

1. Establish the negative Xiangyi:
   T ⊥ F, P ⊢

2. Introduce the new token pair:
   T_old ⊢ T
   (t_new, t_old) ⊢ T
   ────────────────
   T ⊢ T

3. Exploit the negative Xiangyi:
   T ⊥ F, P ⊢
   T ⊢ T
   ────────────────
   T ⊢ F', P'

4. Undermine the stability of the liquidity space:
   T ⊢ F', P'
   F', P' ⊢ L', D'
   ────────────────
   T ⊢ L', D'

The proof shows how the attacker can exploit the negative Xiangyi between the Token Pair Set T and the Fee Tier Set F & Distribution Function P to create changes in the Fee Tier Set and Distribution Function, which in turn disrupt the Liquidity Depth Function L and Deformation Tensor D, undermining the stability of the liquidity space.

This sequent calculus-based proof provides a more formal and rigorous representation of the attack, demonstrating how the attacker can leverage the negative Xiangyi to achieve their goal.

Excellent idea! Let's use the concepts of Sheng and Ke to formally represent the negative Xiangyi between a subset of elements in the liquidity space.

In the Thruster Classic AMM system, the liquidity space (Y) can be represented as a collection of interrelated components:

Y = {T, F, P, L, D}

Where:
- T: Token Pair Set
- F: Fee Tier Set
- P: Distribution Function
- L: Liquidity Depth Function
- D: Deformation Tensor

We can define the Sheng and Ke relationships between these components to capture the negative Xiangyi.

Sheng (生) Relationship:
The Sheng relationship represents the generative, productive, or enabling relationship between elements. In the context of the Thruster Classic AMM system, we can define the following Sheng relationships:

- T Sheng F, P
  - Changes in the Token Pair Set (T) can generate or enable changes in the Fee Tier Set (F) and Distribution Function (P).

- F, P Sheng L, D
  - Changes in the Fee Tier Set (F) and Distribution Function (P) can generate or enable changes in the Liquidity Depth Function (L) and Deformation Tensor (D).

Ke (克) Relationship:
The Ke relationship represents the constraining, limiting, or overcoming relationship between elements. In the context of the Thruster Classic AMM system, we can define the following Ke relationship:

- T Ke F, P
  - Changes in the Token Pair Set (T) can constrain or limit the Fee Tier Set (F) and Distribution Function (P).

This Ke relationship between T and (F, P) captures the negative Xiangyi, where the introduction of a new token pair (t_new, t_old) into the Token Pair Set (T) can disrupt the existing Fee Tier Set (F) and Distribution Function (P).

Formally, we can represent this as:

T Ke F, P

This Ke relationship indicates that the attacker can leverage the negative Xiangyi between the Token Pair Set (T) and the Fee Tier Set (F) & Distribution Function (P) to create unfair trading conditions and undermine the stability of the liquidity space (Y).

By using the Sheng and Ke relationships, we can provide a more nuanced and structured representation of the negative Xiangyi within the Thruster Classic AMM system, which can help in understanding and mitigating such attacks.

---

Great, let's convert the Sheng and Ke relationships into a sequent calculus representation.

Sequents representing the Sheng relationships:
- T ⊢ F, P (Changes in T can generate or enable changes in F and P)
- F, P ⊢ L, D (Changes in F and P can generate or enable changes in L and D)

Sequent representing the Ke relationship:
- T ⊥ F, P ⊢ (Changes in T can constrain or limit F and P)

Now, we can use these sequents to formalize the proof of the attack using sequent calculus.

Proof:

1. Establish the Ke relationship (negative Xiangyi):
   T ⊥ F, P ⊢

2. Introduce the new token pair:
   T_old ⊢ T
   (t_new, t_old) ⊢ T
   ────────────────
   T ⊢ T

3. Exploit the negative Xiangyi:
   T ⊥ F, P ⊢
   T ⊢ T
   ────────────────
   T ⊢ F', P'

4. Undermine the stability of the liquidity space:
   T ⊢ F', P'
   F', P' ⊢ L', D'
   ────────────────
   T ⊢ L', D'

The key steps are:

1. Establish the negative Xiangyi (Ke relationship) between the Token Pair Set (T) and the Fee Tier Set (F) & Distribution Function (P).
2. Introduce the new token pair, which changes the Token Pair Set (T).
3. Exploit the negative Xiangyi to trigger changes in the Fee Tier Set (F) and Distribution Function (P).
4. Demonstrate how the changes in F and P can undermine the stability of the Liquidity Depth Function (L) and Deformation Tensor (D), destabilizing the overall liquidity space (Y).

By using the sequent calculus representation, we can formally capture the logical structure of the attack and the relationships between the different components of the Thruster Classic AMM system.

This formal approach helps to clearly articulate the vulnerability and the attacker's exploitation, which can be valuable for understanding, analyzing, and potentially mitigating such attacks in the future.

To redefine the liquidity space in the context of the vulnerability we discussed and then revisit the solution in a more formal Rudin-style approach, we need to establish the relevant concepts and relationships.

Let's redefine the liquidity space and the vulnerability in a more formal manner:

Definitions:
- A: Set of accounts in the liquidity space
- L: Set of liquidatable accounts
- P: Set of paused accounts

Relations:
- Pause: A → P
- Liquidatable: A → L

Axioms:
1. Admin can pause an account: ∀a ∈ A, Admin ⊢ Pause(a)
2. No check for liquidatable account: ∀a ∈ A, Pause(a) ⊢ a ∉ L
3. Liquidation only happens when unpaused: ∀a ∈ A, a ∉ P ⊢ a ∈ L

Vulnerability Theorem:
∀a ∈ A, Admin ⊢ a ∉ L

Proof:
1. From Axiom 1, we have: ∀a ∈ A, Admin ⊢ Pause(a)
2. From Axiom 2, we have: ∀a ∈ A, Pause(a) ⊢ a ∉ L
3. By transitivity, we get: ∀a ∈ A, Admin ⊢ a ∉ L

Mitigation Theorem:
∀a ∈ A, Admin, a ∈ L ⊢ Pause(a)

Proof:
1. Introduce a health check before pausing:
   ∀a ∈ A, Admin, a ∈ L ⊢ Pause(a)
2. Implication rule:
   ∀a ∈ A, Admin ⊢ a ∈ L ⇒ Pause(a)

By redefining the liquidity space, restating the vulnerability and mitigation theorems, and providing a formal proof in a Rudin-style approach, we have a structured and rigorous analysis of the vulnerability and its resolution in the context of the liquidity space. This formal approach helps in clearly defining the problem, the logic behind the vulnerability, and the proposed solution.

In the notation used in Lemma 1, each symbol has a specific meaning:

- ∀a, b ∈ A: This part signifies that we are considering all elements 'a' and 'b' that belong to the set A. The symbol '∀' represents the universal quantifier, meaning "for all" or "for every."

- Admin ⊢ Pause(a): Here, 'Admin ⊢ Pause(a)' denotes that the administrator has the authority to pause account 'a'. The symbol '⊢' represents logical entailment or implication.

- Pause(b): This indicates that account 'b' is paused.

- Pause(a) ∧ Pause(b): The symbol '∧' represents logical conjunction, meaning "and." So, 'Pause(a) ∧ Pause(b)' signifies that both account 'a' and account 'b' are paused.

- a = b: This denotes that account 'a' is equal to account 'b'. The symbol '=' represents equality between the two accounts.

Therefore, in Lemma 1, the statement '∀a, b ∈ A, Admin ⊢ Pause(a) ∧ Pause(b) ⊢ a = b' asserts that for all accounts 'a' and 'b' in the set A, if the administrator has the ability to pause account 'a' and account 'b' is also paused, then account 'a' is equal to account 'b'. This lemma establishes the transitive property of pausing accounts under the given conditions and implications.

If you have any further questions or need clarification on any specific part of the notation or the lemma, feel free to ask!
