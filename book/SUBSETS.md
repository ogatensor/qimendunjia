Okay, let's incorporate the concepts from Definition 1.1.3 into our discussion of the liquidity space:

1. Equality of Sets:
   - According to the definition, two sets A and B are equal (denoted as A = B) if for any object x, x is an element of A if and only if x is an element of B.
   - In the context of the liquidity space, we can use this concept to compare the sets of token pairs T and the sets of fee tiers F.
   - For example, we can say that two liquidity pools have the same token pairs if their respective sets of token pairs are equal: $T_1 = T_2$.

2. Subset Relation:
   - The definition states that set A is a subset of set B (denoted as A ⊆ B) if for any object x, if x is an element of A, then x is also an element of B.
   - In the liquidity space, we can use this concept to compare the sets of token pairs or fee tiers.
   - For example, we can say that the set of token pairs in one liquidity pool is a subset of the set of token pairs in another liquidity pool: $T_1 ⊆ T_2$.

3. Proper Subset:
   - According to the definition, set A is a proper subset of set B (denoted as A ⊂ B) if A is a subset of B and A is not equal to B.
   - In the liquidity space, we can use this concept to express that one set of token pairs or fee tiers is a strict subset of another.
   - For example, we can say that the set of fee tiers in one liquidity pool is a proper subset of the set of fee tiers in another liquidity pool: $F_1 ⊂ F_2$.

4. Superset and Proper Superset:
   - The definition also introduces the concepts of superset and proper superset, which are the reverse relations of subset and proper subset.
   - We can use these concepts to express that one set contains another set, or that one set properly contains another set.
   - For example, we can say that the set of token pairs in one liquidity pool is a superset of the set of token pairs in another liquidity pool: $T_2 ⊇ T_1$.

By incorporating these set-theoretic concepts, we can more precisely describe and reason about the relationships between the different components of the liquidity space, such as the sets of token pairs and fee tiers. This will be useful when analyzing the properties and behavior of the Thruster Classic AMM.
