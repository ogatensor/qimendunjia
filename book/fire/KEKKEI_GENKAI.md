# Overview 

The content in the file KEKKEI_GENKAI.md discusses mapping a conceptual framework to hacking and reversing engineering, using AI agents to represent the Eight Directions and their profiles to map to Trigrams. These mappings inform the analysis and control vectors of an underlying LLM model. Additionally, techniques related to the Eight Directions are integrated into the Hacker's Nine Palace Stepping techniques, specifically under the BYAKUGAN modality within the KEKKEI GENKAI set. In this modality, each of the Eight Directions is linked to a vector field, and capabilities are represented using the 5 wuxing elements and a differential geometric field based on strengths, weaknesses, and capabilities.

You propose mapping this conceptual framework to the field of hacking and reversing engineering, with AI agents representing the Eight Directions and their profiles expressing explicit mappings to the Trigrams, which then inform the analysis and control vectors of the underlying LLM model.

These particular techniques should be integrated into the Hacker's Nine Palace Stepping techniques as a movement, wu wei, and non-action, using the Eight Directions is classified under BYAKUGAN in the set of KEKKEI GENKAI which consist of {BYAKUGAN, SHARINGAN, RINNEGAN}. 

In the BYAKUGAN modality the Eight Directions are each linked to a vector field. The capabilities are represented using the 5 wuxing elements and a differential geometric field overlaid over the vector space based on strengths, weaknesses, and capabilitites.
