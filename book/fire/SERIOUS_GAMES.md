[Harun Farocki's Serious Games](https://www.moma.org/collection/works/143767)

In his video installations Serious Games I–IV, Harun Farocki explores how the U.S. military employs video game technology to train troops for war and to treat an aftereffect of war, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Filmed at the United States Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center, Serious Games I: Watson is Down pairs footage of soldiers at computers engaging in combat-simulation training with scenes from the video games. In Serious Games III: Immersion, Farocki presents footage of a role-playing exercise in which military psychologists demonstrate how to use the PTSD program on their colleagues, who describe traumatic wartime experiences. On a second channel, their descriptions play out as virtual renderings. Farocki calls attention to the subtle differences between the simulations for combat training and PTSD in Serious Games IV: A Sun with No Shadow. With the former, the sun can be programmed to cast shadows in the virtual combat zones, while the latter, less expensive technology does not offer this feature.

## Presentation Overview
### Purpose and Agenda
The purpose of this presentation is to:
- Introduce the idea of using games to support concept and capability development
- Briefly describe some potential benefits of using games to shape the future of the Army
- Describe what the U.S. Army has done recently
- Describe the potential uses across the community
- Spark some thought and discussion about how we can innovate better using 21st Century tools.

### Key Problems
- Warfare is becoming increasingly complex
- Opportunities to gain and maintain an ‘overmatch’ over our adversaries are fleeting
- Our ability to understand the impact of technology in concert with concepts of employment and force organization has been isolated to high-fidelity, expensive, time consuming, and often classified experiments
- Failed programs are too expensive to tolerate
- Soldiers know what they want, but don’t know what can be done. Engineers know what can be done, but don’t know what is needed.
- We need an inexpensive way connect Soldiers to Technologists to rapidly explore future concepts with just enough fidelity to learn what we need to make smart decisions

### Definitions
- **Model:** A physical, mathematical or otherwise logical representation of a system, entity, phenomenon or process.
- **Simulation:** A method of implementing model over time (may or may not include humans in the loop)
- **Game:** A simulation that includes humans, rules, goals/objectives. Most common purpose is entertainment.
- **Serious Game:** A game that is intended for something else other than entertainment.

## Combat Effectiveness and M&S Tools Available
- **Soldiers:** Knowledge, Skills, Abilities, Leadership
- **Leaders:** Doctrine, Tactics
- **Tools:** Vehicles, Weapons, Equipment
- Many M&S Tools Available
- Desired Game Environments

## Potential Benefits
- Soldiers at the Center of Capability Development
- Explore options when design changes are the least expensive
- Iterate through many doctrine, organization, materiel solutions in a shorter period of time

## Early Synthetic Prototyping Vision
Early Synthetic Prototyping (ESP) enables the Army to conduct ‘early fidelity’ exploration of Doctrine, Organization, and Materiel solutions in game environments to support the development of the future force. ESP is comprised of three main components:
1. Collaboration, feedback, and game analytic/post-experiment tools
   - This is the main effort of Early Synthetic Prototyping.
2. Game environment(s)
   - A small unit, first-person shooter game environment to examine how Soldiers interact with individual pieces of equipment at a small unit level.
   - A large unit, strategy game environment to examine how units composed of future capabilities are organized and employed on the battlefield.
3. Distribution and network capability
   - This is needed to deliver and host the game environment(s) and the feedback, collaboration and game analytic tools.

## Two Game Environments
- **First-Person Shooter**
- **Turn-Based Strategy**

## Soldier Engagement and Feedback
- 85% of Soldiers play military-themed video games
- 50% of Soldiers play more than 10 hours per week
- Following a proof of concept test with Soldiers:
  - 80% would contribute to future efforts to develop or test ideas in a game environment
  - 78% would likely participate in their off-duty time
  - 86% would provide feedback at the end of their game play
  - 87% thought they could innovate in the game environment
  - 75% thought the game was immersive enough that results would correlate to the real world

## Potential Benefits to the Community
- Low cost game environments can be used to explore interoperability challenges when design changes are inexpensive.
- Continuous experimentation could lead to better shared understanding of the problem, or at least identify where we ‘agree to disagree.’
- Games can ‘hide’ classified/proprietary capabilities to protect national and industry sensitive research and development.
- Develop future capabilities to meet future needs, not today’s needs.

## Challenges and Barriers
- Not all capabilities can be properly modeled in a game.
- Game analytics is currently focused on making commercial games more profitable. We need to better understand how to use game analytics.
- We need a better understanding about Soldier motivation to participate.
- We need a better understanding about the quality of Soldier feedback and its usefulness.
- Developing new tools and simulations is challenging. However, these challenges are not as great as changing the way people work. Therefore, the strongest barrier is our own organization's business rules.

## The Early Synthetic Prototyping Team

## Conclusion
Innovation in the 21st Century requires 21st Century tools and techniques. Game environments potentially hold the key to rapid, low-cost innovation that can enable Soldiers, scientists, engineers, academia, and industry to turn ideas into valued outcomes.

## Questions and Discussion

## Back Up Slides

## Reduces Risk and Development Costs
### Cost of a Design Change
- **Basic Concept**
- **Evaluation**
- **Detailed Design**
- **Real Prototype**
- **Live Testing**
- **Production**
- **Fielding**
Current method does not get Soldier input/feedback in large numbers until production/fielding when design changes are costly or prohibitive. The goal is to incorporate the operational experience of Soldiers earlier in the development process where design changes are not as costly.

## Early Synthetic Prototyping
Enables early feedback to drive design when changes are inexpensive.

## Soldiers at the Center of Capability Development
- Soldiers are not typically an integral part of developing solutions.
- Explores doctrine, organization, and materiel solutions in isolation.
- Concept Developers, Capability Developers, Scientists and Engineers seldom get timely feedback from Soldiers.
- The linear, top-down, sequential process produces solutions that may not adequately address the real problem.
- Soldiers co-develop solution so outcome fits the need.
- Explores doctrine, organization, and materiel solutions in the same environment.
- Concept Developers, Capability Developers, Scientists and Engineers interact continuously – with the Soldier as the focus.
- Work problem and solution in tandem - Develop requirements, training, and implementation doctrine as technology is developed.
Putting Soldiers at the Center of Capability/Concept Development leveraging 21st Century Tools

## Current System vs ESP System
Goal is to reduce this cycle to 2-3 weeks

## Early Synthetic Prototyping Cycle
- Models and Scenarios Provided to Soldiers
- Soldiers Assess Future Capability or Concept in the Game Environment
- Engineers Analyze Soldier Feedback
- Engineers Provide Reasonable Description of New Capability to Modelers
- Modelers Build New Capability in the Game Environment
- New Operational Concept Feedback informs:
  - S&T investment
  - Concept Development
  - Doctrine
  - Organization
  - Training/Education
- New S&T Idea

Allow the Army to iterate through potential Doctrine, Organization, Materiel solutions faster
