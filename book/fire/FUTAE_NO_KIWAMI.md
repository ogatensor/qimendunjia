# FUTAE NO KIWAMI

# During the Meiji Restoration

    In Rurouni Kenshin, Sanosuke Sagara and Yūkyūzan Anji fight in episode 47 and act 109. Sanosuke is a strong fighter who uses a large Japanese sword called a zanbato and is known for his brawling style and endurance. Anji has developed a technique called Futae no Kiwami, which allows him to strike an object quickly with milliseconds between each attack. 

### Abilities

Anji developed a technique which he named Futae no Kiwami (Double Layer Limit, Mastery of Two Layers, or Two-fold Extremity). This allows him to strike an object quickly, with only milliseconds between each attack. He completely destroys the object, letting the first strike dissipate the natural resistance of the object and the second strike destroying the object while it is weakened. Anji is able to use this technique with, not only his fists, but also with his head, elbows, knees and feet. Anji also created several techniques derived from the Futae no Kiwami.

The provided `getWithdrawalLimitInternal` function is vulnerable to manipulation due to underflow, as discussed in the proof by contradiction. Here are some key points to consider:

1. **Underflow Vulnerability:** The vulnerability arises from the calculation of `minimumCollateral`, where an attacker can manipulate the oracle price to cause underflow, leading to a very small or potentially zero `minimumCollateral` value.

2. **Incorrect Withdrawal Limit:** If the `minimumCollateral` calculation results in underflow, the subtraction operation `collateralBalance - minimumCollateral` may lead to an inflated withdrawal limit. This allows users to withdraw more collateral than they are entitled to, compromising the system's integrity.

3. **Risk Mitigation:** To address this vulnerability, it is crucial to implement proper checks and safeguards in the function to prevent underflow situations. This may involve validating input values, using safe arithmetic operations, and considering edge cases to ensure the correctness of the withdrawal limit calculation.

4. **Code Review and Testing:** Conduct a thorough code review and testing to identify and rectify potential vulnerabilities in the function. Consider using tools like static analysis and auditing to enhance the security of the smart contract.

By addressing the underflow vulnerability and ensuring robustness in the function's logic, you can mitigate the risk of incorrect withdrawal limits and safeguard the users' assets in the system. If you have any specific questions or need assistance in enhancing the function's security, feel free to ask!
