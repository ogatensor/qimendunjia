- Learn about the different types of cybersecurity tools, including physical tools and software tools
- Understand that a tool can have a legitimate use but can also be used as a weapon by a hacker
- Be aware that an attacker can use a tool like an SSH client for malicious purposes, such as reverse SSH tunneling to attack systems and bypass firewalls

The passage discusses the [[_Bansenshūkai]], a Japanese text on the art of [[ninjutsu]], and its perspective on the use of tools by shinobi (ninja). The key points are:

1. Practicality is important, but the essential principle is not just about wielding the tools, but rather having an enlightened, Zen-like understanding of their purpose.

2. Shinobi would contemplate the usefulness of their tools deeply and frequently. They would constantly train with the tools and reimagine their potential uses in the field.

3. As a result of this deep contemplation and training, shinobi regularly improved existing tools, invented new ones, and passed this knowledge on to other allied shinobi.

The passage suggests that for the shinobi, the mastery of tools was not just about their practical application, but also about developing a profound, almost spiritual understanding of their purpose and potential. This holistic approach led to continuous innovation and the sharing of knowledge within the shinobi community.

Here's an explanation of the key points in simpler English:

1. In addition to having the potential to be used for good or bad, each tool can also be used for purposes other than its original intended use.

2. Take a hammer as an example. If you think about it, a hammer can be used in many different ways beyond just hammering nails - it can be repurposed in various creative ways.

3. Doing simple exercises like this to explore the different uses of a tool can deepen your understanding of what the tool is, how it could be improved, and how a new type of that tool could be invented to do something novel.

4. These same creative skills of repurposing and reimagining the uses of a tool can be applied to digital and software-based tools as well.

5. At the highest levels of mastery, this creative repurposing of tools is similar to the work of a master blacksmith. The blacksmith can forge entirely new tools, machines, and systems that fundamentally change how they approach their craft.

6. This allows the blacksmith to open up new possibilities for what they can create, and enhances their ability to develop new weapons, defenses, and tools.

The key idea is that truly understanding a tool involves exploring its many potential uses beyond its original purpose, which can lead to new innovations and capabilities. This applies to both physical and digital/software tools.

In this chapter, we will contemplate tools. We’ll touch on the dual nature of tools—how the same tool has the capability to do good or bad, depending on its operator. This binary _in-yo_, or _ying-yang_, concept is a useful model to understand how a hacker approaches digital tools. For example, consider how a tool designed to help a user might be used for malicious purposes.
