The interactive digital system includes instructor and
student guides, tactical materials, After Action Review
guides, and VBS2 game scenario files. The use of
graphic novels to augment the serious game training
allows learners to review tasks before and after
gameplay. The graphic novels are reminiscent of the
U.S. Army comic book series popular in the 1960â€™s
called the U.S. Army Preventive Maintenance Manual
published by PS magazine. Since the content of the
training support package (TSP) tasks must be accurate,
this stylistic approach allows more tolerance for lengthy
sections of text as it ties the TSP graphic novel to a
format that is familiar. The comic book format focuses
on episodic story elements (McCloud, 1993).

## Can we extend McCarthy's idea of Castle Theory Thought Excersices? 

CASTLE THEORY THOUGHT EXERCISE
Consider the scenario in which you are the ruler of a medieval castle with valuable assets within your stronghold. You receive credible threat intelligence that a ninja plans to infiltrate your castle and set fire to the food supply in your dungeon. The dungeon has multiple ingress/egress points whereby staff transport food, moving freely and without monitoring.

Consider what measures guards could take to protect food from a fire in the basement. What staffing changes could you implement to control human interactions with the food and protect it from harm? What measures would ensure that guards could quickly observe, report, and respond to fire in the basement? How could guards detect a ninja infiltrating the basement, and what architectural changes could be made to mitigate blind spots that allow access to the food?

Note that while it would be advisable to have backup food supplies in alternate locations or to store the food within fire-resistant material, for this exercise, consider how guards could control and protect the food rather than directly address the fire threat.

The section titled "CASTLE THEORY THOUGHT EXERCISE" in the document is a strategic exercise designed to stimulate thinking about security and protection measures in a hypothetical scenario. In this scenario, you are the ruler of a medieval castle under threat from a ninja planning to sabotage your food supply stored in the dungeon. The exercise challenges you to think about various security measures without directly addressing the threat of fire but focusing on preventing the sabotage through human and architectural interventions.

Key points to consider in the exercise include:

1. **Guard Measures**: Implementing strategies for guards to protect the food, such as increased patrols or specialized training to detect and respond to intrusions.
2. **Staffing Changes**: Adjusting how staff interact with the food supplies to minimize risk, possibly by restricting access or enhancing supervision.
3. **Architectural Modifications**: Making changes to the dungeon's design to eliminate blind spots and secure ingress/egress points to make it harder for an intruder to access the food unnoticed.

This thought exercise is a method to explore complex security solutions creatively, drawing parallels to modern security challenges in a more engaging and relatable way.
