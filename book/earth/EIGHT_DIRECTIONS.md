## The Eight Directions

# NOTE:

We imagine the reversing and engineering process as equivalent to wushu. We understand the importance of WUYI. We exist in an interconnected system and in the context of digital spaces like metaverses, virtual battlespaces, mmorpgs, and geophysical realities of network infrastructure across the electromagnetic spectrum that we must learn from the ancient sage-scholars and syncretize their guidance along with the discoveries of modernity. AI agents, being integrated into the reversing and engineering process as emanations of these Eight directions and the agent profiles express explicit mappings keyed to one of the eight trigrams that point toward a control vector C of where a max of three "control descriptors" weight the analysis of the underlying LLM model.

The bagua is a set of symbols from China intended to illustrate the nature of reality as being composed of mutually opposing forces reinforcing one another.

In Chinese philosophy
, the eight directions are represented by the eight trigrams
, or bagua (八卦), which are arranged in an octagon:
Zhen (☳): Thunder, east, spring equinox, and wood
Xun (☴): Wind, southeast, and wood
Li (☲): Fire, south, summer solstice, and fire
Kun (☷): Earth, southwest, and earth
Dui (☱): Lake, west, fall equinox, and metal
Qian (☰): Heaven, northwest, and metal
Kan (☵): Water, north, winter solstice
, and water
Gen (☶): Mountain, northeast, and eart

The eight trigrams are arranged in a clockwise sequence starting from the east. The order of the trigrams is used to explain the universe and was the basis for the Chinese calendar. 
The eight trigrams represent different aspects of human consciousness and personality. The black-and-white fish-shaped patterns in the center of the octagon represent the opposing forces of yin and yang
. The solid lines represent yang, the creative principle, and the open lines represent yin, the receptive principle. 
The bagua is a key tool in Feng Shui, the Chinese art
 of creating harmonious living spaces. In Feng Shui, the bagua is used to evaluate the energy field of an environment and show relationships between natural elements, colors, and areas of life.

# Contextual Selections

“Chinese martial arts imitate the Bagua pattern, described in the Zhou Yi (周易) (Zhou’s Book of Changes), in order to express the pattern’s different phases. For example, in the Zhou Yi, Qian (乾) represents the heaven (extreme Yang) and Kun (坤) represents the earth (extreme Yin). Between heaven and earth, Qi circulates and life is created. This is called the “Grand circulation” (Da Zhou Tian, 大周天). ”

The magic map named bagua (eight diagrams) explains the constitution of the universe, where everything features yin and yang. According to Fuxi, the map would help people speculate and understand the world, such as why the weather changes, why day and night exchange and why it rains or the wind blows.

“In the Zhou Yi, the symbol of Kan (坎) (l) is a “caved-in” line (i.e., broken line) on the top and bottom, and in Baguazhang, it symbolizes the ears, which are considered hollow in the center. In Chinese martial arts, Kan signifies fullness and substantialness internally, and void and false externally. The words “Kan Zhong Man” (坎中滿) (i.e., Kan center full) can often be seen in the martial arts secret songs and poems, especially in the internal martial styles. Kan here implies the abdomen, where the Qi within must be full and abundant. Since the Qi (also called original Qi or Yuan Qi, 元氣) stored in the Lower Dan Tian originates with the original essence (Yuan Jing, 元精), which is stored and produced in the kidneys, it is believed that the kidneys should belong to Kan.”

“In the martial arts, techniques and strategies are sometimes linked with the Eight Trigrams. For example, in Taijiquan, the eight basic techniques are compared with the Eight Post-Heaven Trigrams. In Zhang, San-Feng’s (張三豐) Taijiquan Treatise, it says: “What are the thirteen postures? Peng (Wardoff), Lu (Rollback), Ji (Press), An (Push), Cai (Pluck), Lie (Split), Zhou (Elbow-Stroke), Kao (Shoulder-Stroke), these are the Eight Trigrams. Jin Bu (Forward), Tui Bu (Backward), Zuo Gu (Beware of the Left), You Pan (Look to the Right), Zhong Ding (Central Equilibrium), these are the Five Elements. Peng, Lu, Ji, and An are Qian (Heaven), Kun (Earth), Kan (Water), and Li (Fire), and are the four main sides. Cai, Lie, Zhou, and Kao are Xun (Wind), Zhen (Thunder), Dui (Lake), and Gen (Mountain), and are the four diagonal corners. Forward, Backward, Beware of the Left, Look to the Right, and Central Equilibrium are Jin (Metal), Mu (Wood), Shui (Water), Huo (Fire), and Tu (Earth). All together they are the thirteen postures.”
