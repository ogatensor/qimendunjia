# Seas and Oceans 

# Overview 

The text from the file [book/earth/SEAS_AND_OCEANS.md](file:///Users/andrewowens/qimendunjia/book/earth/SEAS_AND_OCEANS.md#1%2C1-1%2C1) discusses two main topics:

1. **Historical Maps and Mapping Virtual Environments**:
   - It lists several bodies of water, all part of or connected to the Pacific Ocean, primarily located in Southeast Asia. These include various seas such as the China Sea, Yellow Sea, East China Sea, South China Sea, and others.
   - This section emphasizes the importance of these bodies of water in historical and geographical contexts, possibly for educational or navigational purposes.

2. **Blockchain Network Mapping**:
   - This section appears to begin a discussion on the application of traditional cartographic techniques in modern contexts, such as blockchain and the cyber realm. It suggests that understanding traditional mapping (like land navigation and naval warfare) is beneficial for mastering newer domains like blockchain networks, the metaverse, and technologies related to artificial intelligence and wearables.
   - The mention of military contexts implies a focus on strategic applications of mapping in both historical and contemporary settings.

Overall, the text connects the art and science of traditional mapping with modern technological applications, highlighting the evolving nature of navigation and strategy in different realms.

Historical Maps and Mapping Virtual Environments

From the provided map image, here is a list of the oceans and seas:

1. Pacific Ocean
2. China Sea
3. Yellow Sea
4. East China Sea
5. South China Sea
6. Philippine Sea
7. Celebes Sea
8. Java Sea
9. Timor Sea
10. Arafura Sea

These bodies of water are part of the larger Pacific Ocean and are located in and around Southeast Asia, as depicted on the historical map.

# Blockchain Network Mapping 

It may behoove the sage-scholar, in understanding the techniques of the cartographer, often thrown into new environments with strict requirements on
information of importance, especially in military contexts. 

Land navigation and Naval warfare are two domains a commander must have mastery in both.
