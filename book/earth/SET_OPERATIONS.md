Okay, let's do an example that showcases how the set operations defined in Definition 1.1.2 can be useful in the context of the liquidity space.

Example:
Suppose we have three liquidity pools: Pool A, Pool B, and Pool C. Each pool has its own set of token pairs and fee tiers. Let's denote the sets as follows:

- Token pairs:
  - Pool A: $T_A$
  - Pool B: $T_B$
  - Pool C: $T_C$
- Fee tiers:
  - Pool A: $F_A$
  - Pool B: $F_B$
  - Pool C: $F_C$

Now, let's consider the following scenarios and see how the set operations can be useful:

1. **Identifying the unique token pairs across all pools:**
   - To find the set of all unique token pairs supported by the Thruster Classic AMM, we can use the union operation:
     - $T = T_A \cup T_B \cup T_C$
   - This gives us the complete set of token pairs that can be traded across the three pools.

2. **Determining the common fee tiers across all pools:**
   - To find the set of fee tiers that are shared by all three pools, we can use the intersection operation:
     - $F = F_A \cap F_B \cap F_C$
   - This allows us to identify the fee tiers that are supported by the Thruster Classic AMM across all its liquidity pools.

3. **Analyzing the differences in fee tiers between pools:**
   - To find the fee tiers that are unique to Pool B compared to Pool A, we can use the complement operation:
     - $F_B \setminus F_A$
   - This gives us the set of fee tiers that are available in Pool B but not in Pool A, which can be useful for understanding the differences in fee structures between the two pools.

4. **Identifying the token pairs and fee tiers exclusive to a specific pool:**
   - To find the token pairs and fee tiers that are unique to Pool C, we can use the complement operation:
     - $T_C \setminus (T_A \cup T_B)$
     - $F_C \setminus (F_A \cup F_B)$
   - These sets represent the token pairs and fee tiers that are exclusively available in Pool C, which can be valuable information for users and developers.

By using the set operations defined in Definition 1.1.2, we can gain valuable insights into the capabilities and features of the Thruster Classic AMM, such as the breadth of supported token pairs, the common fee tiers, and the differences between individual liquidity pools. These insights can help users make informed decisions about which pools to use and how to optimize their trading strategies.

Okay, let's try an example that combines the concepts from Notation 1.1.1 (logical implications and bi-implications) and Definition 1.1.3 (the liquidity space and its components) in the context of the Thruster Classic AMM.

Example:
Suppose we have two liquidity pools, Pool A and Pool B, with the following properties:

1. Logical Implications and Bi-implications:
   - Let P(f, t) be the price function for the token pair in Pool A, and Q(f, t) be the price function for the token pair in Pool B.
   - We know that:
     - If the liquidity depth L(A) in Pool A increases, then the Deformation Tensor D(L(A), P(f, t)) for Pool A changes.
     - Formally: $L(A, t_2) > L(A, t_1) \Rightarrow D(L(A, t_2), P(f, t_2)) \neq D(L(A, t_1), P(f, t_1))$
     - The liquidity depth L(B) in Pool B is constant if and only if the Deformation Tensor D(L(B), Q(f, t)) for Pool B is zero.
     - Formally: $L(B, t) = L(B, t_0) \forall t \geq t_0 \Leftrightarrow D(L(B, t), Q(f, t)) = 0 \forall t \geq t_0$

2. The Liquidity Space and Its Components:
   - The liquidity space $\mathcal{L}$ is the collection of all liquidity pools in the Thruster Classic AMM.
   - Each liquidity pool $\mathcal{L}_i$ in the liquidity space $\mathcal{L}$ has the following components:
     - Token pair set $T_i$
     - Fee tier set $F_i$
     - Liquidity depth $L_i$
     - Price function $P_i(f, t)$
     - Deformation Tensor $D_i(L_i, P_i(f, t))$

Now, let's consider the following scenarios and see how the concepts from Notation 1.1.1 and Definition 1.1.3 can be used:

1. **Analyzing the changes in liquidity depth and deformation tensor:**
   - Since the liquidity depth L(A) in Pool A increases, we can use the implication from Notation 1.1.1 to conclude that the Deformation Tensor D(L(A), P(f, t)) for Pool A changes.
   - This means that the price function P(f, t) in Pool A is affected by the changes in the liquidity depth, as described by the Deformation Tensor.

2. **Comparing the properties of the two pools:**
   - From Definition 1.1.3, we know that each liquidity pool $\mathcal{L}_i$ in the liquidity space $\mathcal{L}$ has a set of token pairs $T_i$ and a set of fee tiers $F_i$.
   - We can compare the token pair sets and fee tier sets of Pool A and Pool B to understand the differences in the capabilities of the two pools.
   - For example, if $T_A \neq T_B$, it means that the two pools support different sets of token pairs, which can be valuable information for users.
   - Similarly, if $F_A \neq F_B$, it indicates that the two pools have different fee structures, which can affect the trading costs for users.

3. **Analyzing the constancy of liquidity depth and deformation tensor:**
   - From the bi-implication in Notation 1.1.1, we can see that the liquidity depth L(B) in Pool B is constant if and only if the Deformation Tensor D(L(B), Q(f, t)) for Pool B is zero.
   - This means that if the liquidity depth in Pool B remains constant over time, the price function Q(f, t) in Pool B is not affected by changes in the liquidity depth, as described by the Deformation Tensor.

By combining the logical implications and bi-implications from Notation 1.1.1 with the components of the liquidity space from Definition 1.1.3, we can gain a deeper understanding of the properties and behavior of the Thruster Classic AMM's liquidity pools. This knowledge can be valuable for users, developers, and researchers working with the Thruster Classic AMM.

Okay, let's try a more advanced example that combines the concepts from Notation 1.1.1, Definition 1.1.3, and the set operations from Definition 1.1.2 in the context of the Thruster Classic AMM.

Example:
Suppose we have three liquidity pools in the Thruster Classic AMM: Pool A, Pool B, and Pool C. Each pool has the following properties:

1. Logical Implications and Bi-implications:
   - Let P(f, t), Q(f, t), and R(f, t) be the price functions for the token pairs in Pool A, Pool B, and Pool C, respectively.
   - We know that:
     - If the fee tier f in Pool A increases, then the Deformation Tensor D(L(A), P(f, t)) for Pool A also increases.
     - Formally: $f_2 > f_1 \Rightarrow D(L(A), P(f_2, t)) > D(L(A), P(f_1, t))$
     - The liquidity depth L(B) in Pool B is constant if and only if the Deformation Tensor D(L(B), Q(f, t)) for Pool B is zero.
     - Formally: $L(B, t) = L(B, t_0) \forall t \geq t_0 \Leftrightarrow D(L(B, t), Q(f, t)) = 0 \forall t \geq t_0$

2. The Liquidity Space and Its Components:
   - The liquidity space $\mathcal{L}$ is the collection of all liquidity pools in the Thruster Classic AMM.
   - Each liquidity pool $\mathcal{L}_i$ in the liquidity space $\mathcal{L}$ has the following components:
     - Token pair set $T_i$
     - Fee tier set $F_i$
     - Liquidity depth $L_i$
     - Price function $P_i(f, t)$
     - Deformation Tensor $D_i(L_i, P_i(f, t))$

3. Set Operations:
   - The token pair sets for the three pools are: $T_A$, $T_B$, and $T_C$.
   - The fee tier sets for the three pools are: $F_A$, $F_B$, and $F_C$.

Now, let's consider the following scenarios and see how the concepts from Notation 1.1.1, Definition 1.1.3, and Definition 1.1.2 can be used:

1. **Identifying the unique token pairs across all pools:**
   - To find the set of all unique token pairs supported by the Thruster Classic AMM, we can use the union operation:
     - $T = T_A \cup T_B \cup T_C$
   - This gives us the complete set of token pairs that can be traded across the three pools.

2. **Analyzing the impact of fee tier changes on the deformation tensor:**
   - From the implication in Notation 1.1.1, we know that if the fee tier f in Pool A increases, the Deformation Tensor D(L(A), P(f, t)) for Pool A also increases.
   - This means that changes in the fee tiers can affect the price function P(f, t) in Pool A, as described by the Deformation Tensor.
   - Similarly, we can analyze the impact of fee tier changes on the deformation tensors in Pool B and Pool C.

3. **Comparing the constancy of liquidity depth and deformation tensor:**
   - From the bi-implication in Notation 1.1.1, we know that the liquidity depth L(B) in Pool B is constant if and only if the Deformation Tensor D(L(B), Q(f, t)) for Pool B is zero.
   - This means that if the liquidity depth in Pool B remains constant over time, the price function Q(f, t) in Pool B is not affected by changes in the liquidity depth, as described by the Deformation Tensor.
   - We can compare this to the properties of Pool A and Pool C to understand the differences in the behavior of the liquidity pools.

4. **Identifying the common and unique fee tiers across pools:**
   - To find the set of fee tiers that are common to all three pools, we can use the intersection operation:
     - $F = F_A \cap F_B \cap F_C$
   - To find the fee tiers that are unique to Pool B compared to Pool A, we can use the complement operation:
     - $F_B \setminus F_A$
   - These set operations can provide insights into the similarities and differences in the fee structures of the three pools.

By combining the concepts from Notation 1.1.1, Definition 1.1.3, and Definition 1.1.2, we can gain a comprehensive understanding of the Thruster Classic AMM's liquidity pools, their properties, and the relationships between them. This knowledge can be valuable for users, developers, and researchers working with the Thruster Classic AMM, as it allows them to analyze the capabilities, behavior, and differences between the various liquidity pools.

Great, let's explore how we can leverage tensor contraction and Dedekind cuts in the context of the Thruster Classic AMM and the liquidity space.

1. **Tensor Contraction**:
   - The Deformation Tensor $D_i(L_i, P_i(f, t))$ for each liquidity pool $\mathcal{L}_i$ can be viewed as a tensor.
   - Tensor contraction can be used to analyze the relationships between the different components of the Deformation Tensor:
     - Liquidity depth $L_i$
     - Price function $P_i(f, t)$
     - Potentially other relevant factors
   - By contracting the tensor, we can gain insights into how changes in the liquidity depth and fee tiers affect the price function, as described by the Deformation Tensor.
   - This can help us understand the sensitivity of the price function to various parameters and how the different liquidity pools respond to these changes.

2. **Dedekind Cuts**:
   - The liquidity space $\mathcal{L}$ can be seen as a collection of liquidity pools, each with its own set of token pairs $T_i$ and fee tiers $F_i$.
   - We can use Dedekind cuts to partition the liquidity space based on these sets:
     - Partition the liquidity space based on the token pair sets: $\mathcal{L} = \{L_i | T_i = T\}$
     - Partition the liquidity space based on the fee tier sets: $\mathcal{L} = \{L_i | F_i = F\}$
   - This can help us identify subspaces within the liquidity space that share common properties, such as the same set of token pairs or fee tiers.
   - These subspaces can be useful for various applications, such as:
     - Optimizing user routing between liquidity pools based on their specific requirements
     - Analyzing the overall depth and liquidity of the Thruster Classic AMM for different token pairs and fee tiers
     - Identifying potential arbitrage opportunities between the different liquidity pools

By applying tensor contraction and Dedekind cuts, we can gain a deeper understanding of the Thruster Classic AMM's liquidity space and the relationships between its various components. This can lead to insights that can be leveraged for improved user experience, more efficient trading strategies, and better overall management of the Thruster Classic AMM.

Okay, let's go through some examples to illustrate how we can leverage tensor contraction and Dedekind cuts, along with the Kronecker delta function, in the context of the Thruster Classic AMM.

Example 1: Analyzing the impact of fee tier changes on the Deformation Tensor

Let's consider three liquidity pools: Pool A, Pool B, and Pool C, each with their own Deformation Tensor:
- $D_A(L_A, P_A(f, t))$
- $D_B(L_B, P_B(f, t))$
- $D_C(L_C, P_C(f, t))$

We want to understand how changes in the fee tiers affect the Deformation Tensors of the different pools.

Using tensor contraction, we can isolate the impact of fee tier changes on the Deformation Tensor for each pool:
- $D_A(L_A, P_A(f, t)) \cdot \delta_{f_A, f}$
- $D_B(L_B, P_B(f, t)) \cdot \delta_{f_B, f}$
- $D_C(L_C, P_C(f, t)) \cdot \delta_{f_C, f}$

Here, the Kronecker delta function $\delta_{f_i, f}$ allows us to select the components of the Deformation Tensor that are affected by changes in the fee tier $f$.

By analyzing these contracted tensors, we can compare the sensitivity of the price functions $P_A(f, t)$, $P_B(f, t)$, and $P_C(f, t)$ to fee tier changes across the different liquidity pools.

Example 2: Identifying common and unique fee tiers using Dedekind cuts

Let's assume the following fee tier sets for the three liquidity pools:
- $F_A = \{0.01, 0.03, 0.05\}$
- $F_B = \{0.01, 0.02, 0.04\}$
- $F_C = \{0.01, 0.03, 0.06\}$

We can use Dedekind cuts to find the common and unique fee tiers across the pools:

1. Common fee tiers:
   - $F = F_A \cap F_B \cap F_C = \{0.01\}$

2. Unique fee tiers for Pool B:
   - $F_B \setminus F_A = \{0.02, 0.04\}$

3. Unique fee tiers for Pool C:
   - $F_C \setminus F_A = \{0.06\}$

This information can be useful for understanding the similarities and differences in the fee structures of the three liquidity pools, which can impact user trading costs and strategies.

Example 3: Comparing liquidity pool properties using the Kronecker delta

Let's assume we have the following liquidity pools:
- Pool A: $\mathcal{L}_A$ with token pair set $T_A = \{A, B\}$ and fee tier set $F_A = \{0.01, 0.03\}$
- Pool B: $\mathcal{L}_B$ with token pair set $T_B = \{A, C\}$ and fee tier set $F_B = \{0.01, 0.02\}$
- Pool C: $\mathcal{L}_C$ with token pair set $T_C = \{B, C\}$ and fee tier set $F_C = \{0.03, 0.06\}$

We can use the Kronecker delta function to compare the properties of these liquidity pools:

1. Comparing token pair sets:
   - $\delta_{T_A, T_B} = 0$ (the token pair sets are different)
   - $\delta_{T_A, T_C} = 0$ (the token pair sets are different)
   - $\delta_{T_B, T_C} = 0$ (the token pair sets are different)

2. Comparing fee tier sets:
   - $\delta_{F_A, F_B} = 0$ (the fee tier sets are different)
   - $\delta_{F_A, F_C} = 0$ (the fee tier sets are different)
   - $\delta_{F_B, F_C} = 0$ (the fee tier sets are different)

This analysis shows that the three liquidity pools have completely different token pair sets and fee tier sets, indicating that they serve distinct purposes and may have different characteristics in terms of liquidity depth, price sensitivity, and user trading behavior.

These examples demonstrate how tensor contraction, Dedekind cuts, and the Kronecker delta function can be used to gain insights into the Thruster Classic AMM's liquidity space and the relationships between its various components. By applying these techniques, we can better understand the capabilities, behavior, and differences between the liquidity pools, which can inform decision-making, trading strategies, and overall management of the Thruster Classic AMM.
