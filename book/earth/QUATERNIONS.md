/**
 * Quaternions are a number system that extends the complex numbers. They are defined as an ordered set of four real numbers (a, b, c, d) and can be represented as:
 * q = a + bi + cj + dk
 * where:
 * - a, b, c, d are real numbers
 * - i, j, k are imaginary units that satisfy the following relationships:
 *   i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1
 * Quaternions have applications in various fields such as computer graphics, robotics, and physics due to their ability to represent rotations in 3D space efficiently.

## Axioms

1. **Quaternion Definition**: A quaternion q is an ordered set of four real numbers (a, b, c, d) represented as q = a + bi + cj + dk.
2. **Imaginary Units**: The imaginary units i, j, k satisfy the relationships i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1.

## Theorems

1. **Efficient Representation Theorem**: Quaternions efficiently represent rotations in 3D space.
2. **Application Theorem**: Quaternions find applications in computer graphics, robotics, and physics.
