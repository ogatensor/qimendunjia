Theorem 1.1.1

The hacker's movements and actions are coordinated with the principles of the Nine Palace Stepping. 

Theorem 1.1.2

The hacker's movements and actions are coordinated with the principles of the Nine Palace Stepping. They seamlessly transition between left and right, constantly refining their techniques and exploiting vulnerabilities. Their attacks can either follow the target's defenses or reverse the flow, catching the opponent off guard. The hacker's steps are adaptable, opening and closing access points, utilizing all available resources (the four extremities) to their advantage.

Theorem 1.1.3

When a hacker "walks" through a system, they carefully analyze the target's defenses, identifying potential access points and weaknesses that can be exploited. This process of walking through the system allows the hacker to adapt their approach, open and close access points as needed, and utilize all available resources to their advantage, similar to how the martial artist uses their four extremities in combat.
